With Madam Lau’s method, moisture content readings were taken invariably at various checkpoints without identifying reference points at the dry and non-seepage areas. 32. The defendant criticized that this method was contrary to the established “reference points - cum - checkpoints” approach which was adopted by both the Joint Office and the Consultant in their moisture content tests. Reference is made to the HKIS Guide which specifies how reference points should be identified. “Select and clearly mark three to ten checkpoints (CPs) within the seepage area. Check the moisture contents of the CPs with a moisture meter … Record the EMM [electrical moisture meter] readings of at least four additional reference areas (RPs) outside, but adjacent to the seepage area. The RPs should be in a dry area with the same construction material as that of the affected ceiling or wall surface”. 33. Mr Cheung stressed that those readings with moisture content over 35% have to be referenced to other dry surfaces before any leakage can be inferred; otherwise they are simply raw data of no use. To illustrate the importance of reference points, he elaborated under cross-examination that if the moisture content reading of a dry spot (which happened to be located in a tropical and very humid place) is 50%, even there are checkpoints showing moisture content of 60%, it would nonetheless entail a conclusion that there is no water seepage. 34. Madam Lau explained that although she has not given any of the test points the coded name “reference points”, it can be seen from the moisture content measurement that the checkpoints included both damp and dry spots. She said those dry spots at the relatively dry areas are in substance reference points. 35. I have reservation about Madam Lau’s theory which sounds loose and lacks precision. A test point with low moisture content reading within the dry and no seepage area is very different from a test point with the lowest moisture content reading among others all within the seepage area (even it is below the calibrated figure of 18.3%). The former is a reference benchmark to identify whether there is seepage (even if moisture content readings of checkpoints exceed 35%), the latter is not a dry spot as such but only a relatively dry spot by comparison.", "content_summary": "詳細討論濕度內容測試的參考點問題，被告批評專家方法不符合標準，專家辯稱乾點實質上作為參考點，但法官對其方法保留意見，認為缺乏精確性。", "issue_summary": "測試方法是否足夠嚴謹以推斷漏水，以及參考點在檢測中的重要性。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

Further, according to the microwave scan images of the guest bathroom, the part situated closer to the external wall of Flat 13B was blue in colour showing moisture and water seepage.

When combined with water spray test, there will be water movement analysis to show whether water seepage came from the external wall. 55. Different tests serve different purposes. Whether a test is required will depend on the circumstances. If the static analysis shows dampness and signs of seepage, then combining the water spray test is helpful in tracing the source.

As regards the objection to combining moisture content test with dye test, Appendix 7.3 and 7.4 of the HKIS Guide has set out the application procedures of two types of flooding test, one with dye water and the other with clean potable water. Both tests involve taking of moisture content readings, but only the clean water test procedures cover analysis of moisture content after the flooding test that an increase would indicate seepage. It is unclear whether this post-flooding test analysis also applies to the dye water test; if not, the purpose of taking moisture content readings not being mentioned is also in doubt. 67. No information enables the court to understand the difference between clean potable water and dye water in relation to an increase in moisture content readings.

Regarding the 2 nd Ponding Test with negative result , Mr Cheung opined that since there was no dye, it is conclusive that the water-proofing membrane of the floor slab in guest bathroom of Flat 14B was not the source of seepage. He also considered the ponding test a first tier testing method and moisture content test only a supportive measure. 73. It occurred that this “no dye-no source” theory does not gain support from the HKIS Guide. It is stated therein a dye test is not always successful; a failure to record its presence in the damp zone cannot be taken as definite evidence against the suspected source; however a positive test is firm proof of the source. Some factors affecting the result of a dye test are also set out , they include absorption or filtration of dye solutions along the cracks , size and type of the defect, texture of the surface and penetrative properties etc. 74. In the case of Good Century Investment Limited v Yim Kin Kuo and another, DCCJ 4980 of 2013, unreported (23 November 2015), it was held that negative result of the ponding test would not pose any bar to the plaintiff in establishing liability on the defendant’s part. 75. Therefore, I reject Mr Cheung’s theory. If there is no dye, one may regard the possibility of seepage through water -proofing membrane uncertain. However, it cannot be concluded that the water -proofing membrane is not defective for any seepage. 76. I also do not accept that ponding test is a first tier testing method and moisture content test only a supportive measure. As discussed in paragraph 25 above, each method has its strengths, potential pitfalls and limitations. The Ponding test is one of the methods, it is not an indispensable test.

Based on the following, Mr Cheung excluded Flat 14B as the source of leakage. (a) On 17 May 2012, the defendant’s interior designer has recorded abnormal and considerable amount of water underneath the bathtub of the guest bathroom of Flat 14B after removal of old bathtub and wall tiles. The floor slab under the bathtub was fully wetted. (b) As part of the renovation work, the bath tub was changed to tiled shower tray and water-proofing membrane was re-done. (c) Based on his visual inspection during a site visit in 2015 and perusal of documents and photographs, Mr Cheung holds the view that the renovation work in 2012 was carried out effectively with workmanship above standard. (d) Since water was entrapped inside the reinforced concrete slab, it required a considerable time to evaporate. Mr Cheung suggested that the reasonable time for the entrapped water to escape is about 1 to 2 years, in some cases it may take up to 3 years. (e) Therefore, the water seeped to Flat 13B was the water entrapped in the floor slab between Flat 14B and Flat 13B. No water seeped through the water-proofing membrane. Further, external wall is also a possible source of seepage. 78. In his attempt to explain the positive result of the 1st Ponding Test, Mr Cheung under cross-examination mentioned for the first time that the water-proofing membrane of floor slab at the guest bathroom in Flat 14B was damaged during the installation of a doorstop. Dye water seeped through the hole and hence dye was noted in Flat 13B. 79. Mr Cheung went on to say the damage was already fixed during the repairs undertaken by the defendant on 14 May 2013 pursuant to the nuisance notice. However, he did not explain how the hole could not have been the source of seepage during the time before it was repaired. 80. The defendant seeks to distinguish between the liability of the creator of a nuisance and the person who continued with the nuisance.
