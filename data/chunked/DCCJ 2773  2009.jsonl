He asked the Management Office to follow-up the matter. However, the Management Office was unable to gain access into Flat 7B and was unable to contact Mr. Chow again.\n\nii) Mr. Chow called the Management Office at last on 30 September 2008 and arranged for an inspection of Flat 7B on the same morning. Mr. Chow's own technician, Mr. Lau, attended the inspection and performed a water leak test by letting water into the bathtub of Flat 7B. Water leak was then observed at Flat 6B. Mr. Lau performed some repair to the drainage pipes of the relevant bathtub.\n\niii) This repair was not effective and Madam Chan still complained of water leakage on 3 October 2008. Mr. Lau returned on 6 October 2008 and performed further tests. Mr. Lau discussed with Mr. Chow and the tenants of Flat 7B was advised not to use the guest bathroom for 2 days.\n\niv) Despite this, the water leakages continued. The Management Office staff found wetness on the ceiling above the water-heater in the guest bathroom of Flat 6B and suspected that the source of the water leak was from the water pipes of the water heater of Flat 7B. Mr. Lau was notified and he said he would inform Mr. Chow the possibility of turning off the water heater supply of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B for a water leak test.\n\nv) Mr. Lau eventually inspected Flat 6B on 14 October 2008 but thought that this was not a burst water heater pipe at Flat 7B. He suggested that this was due to sand and debris under the bathtub which was retaining the water.\n\nvi) Nevertheless, the water leakages continued. On 28 October 2008, Mr. Lau turned off the water heater supply of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B.\n\nvii) Despite this, the water leak continued. On 31 October 2008, Mr. Lau decided to turned off the master fresh water supply of Flat 7B for a further water leak test.\n\nviii) At last, the water leak started to slow down and the dripping finally stopped on 3 November 2008, some 50 days after this period of water leak first started.\n\nix) When Mr. Lau opened the master fresh water pipe on Flat 7B on 4 November 2008, he observed wetness on the water heater pipes. However, Mr. Lau was still not sure whether this leak was from Flat 7B or the flat above.\n\nx) Mr. Lau therefore devised a test. He advised shutting off the master fresh water supply for another day and arranged an inspection of Flat 7B the next day. If the water heater pipe was found to be wet, the source of the water leak would likely be from the flat above. If it remained dry, the source would most likely be from the fresh water pipe of Flat 7B.\n\nxi) As arranged, on the next day (5 November 2008), two staff members from the Management Office inspected the water heater pipe of Flat 7B and found it to be dry, thus showing that the source was from Flat 7B. Mr. Lau was notified.\n\nxii) As what appeared to be a second test for confirmation, Mr. Lau returned that evening to re-open the master fresh water pipe of Flat 7B. He inspected Flat 6B afterwards and found no immediate water leak.\n\nxiii) However, Madam Chan complained the very next morning, on 6 November 2008, that the water leak increased since the re-opening of the master fresh water pipe of Flat 7B.\n\nxiv) The Management Office staff went up to Flat 7B and found that the left water pipe in the water heater was wet while the right water pipe was dry. Mr. Lau was notified and he advised shutting off the fresh water supply again.\n\nxv) Therefore, Mr. Lau was careful that he repeated his water leak test to confirm that the source of the water leak was, indeed, from the fresh water pipe of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B.", "content_summary": "管理辦公室和技術人員進行多次漏水測試，包括關閉水源和檢查管道，最終確認漏水源頭來自7B單位的淡水管道；過程涉及多次無效修復和測試，凸顯漏水問題的複雜性。", "issue_summary": "通過測試確定漏水源頭的責任歸屬，涉及管理公司和業主的維修義務。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "facts", "embedding_model": null}

It should therefore be obvious, at least to the parties instructing them, that the experts were on cross-purposes right from the beginning: whilst Mr. Wong sought to address the water leak problems past and present, Mr. Ho only sought to address the water leak problems found at the time of inspection on the assumption that there was a continuous on-going one (perhaps relying on the information that there were water leaks during heavy rain in Flat 7B). \n64. This is confirmed by the fact that, when the Court presented the scenario as stated in the Management Report regarding the water leak between September and November 2008, Mr. Ho readily accepted that \"there was a big possibility\" that fresh water pipe leakage from Flat 7B was to account for that. \n65. Mr. Ho then sought to explain himself by stating that he did read the Management Report but thought that it was \"speculation\" for an expert to rely on matters not \"observed first hand\". He argued that he did not want to speculate so his opinion was based only on what he found during the inspection. \n66. There were major flaws in this argument :- \ni) It was simply wrong for an expert to reject outright any evidence simply because this has not been \"observed first hand\" by the expert. To draw an example, a doctor would not be able to (and might not wish to!) \"observe first hand\" every single complaint made by his patient but he would not disregard such information. Disregarding the history of a case was a rejection of an essential part of the investigation, especially in this case because, as discussed above, there appeared to be no further substantial water leak problems at the time of the investigation. Basing an opinion on all available evidence was not \"speculation\". If Mr. Ho was in doubt of the reliability of the Management Report, he should interview the witnesses (for example, the Management Office staff, the Plaintiffs and especially Mr. Lau) to verify the accuracy of the history. There should not be any difficulties in doing so as part of his investigation. \nii) Having rejected, as it appeared, the Management Report on this basis, Mr. Ho appeared to accept the evidence from the tenant of Flat 7B about the incidents of water leaks during heavy rain. Mr. Ho obviously did not \"observe first hand\" such water leakages either. This was an obvious act of \"cherry picking\" at the evidence. \niii) To support Mr. Ho's opinion that the source of the water leakages was from the external walls, the Defendant sought to rely on the fact that several (but not all) complaints of water leaks appeared to coincide with the dates of typhoons or rainstorms. The Defendant did so by cross referring relevant dates in the Management Report to the Hong Kong Observatory records.

Mr. Ho's opinion has further problems : i) It manifestly failed to explain why the water leaks subsided after November 2008 when no repair was done to the external wall all this time. ii) This theory also failed to account for how there could be a continuous water leakage for a period of some 50 days when it was self -evident that there could not have been a continuous rainstorm or typhoon over this period. iii) Putting it in another way, there would be many days over this period of 50 days when the water pressure exerted by (and the duration of) any rainstorms must have been below that of the \"Spray Test to window of Guest Bathroom of Flat 7B\", yet the water had leaked continuously throughout this time when the subsequent \"Spray Test\" yielded no leak. iv) Further, in order to explain the multiple sites of water damages observed in Flat 6B, Mr. Ho proposed an elaborate theory of multiple areas of water entries at the external walls and podium floor tiles , cracks through various parts of cement rendering, cracks though the entire concrete structural walls at various exact areas, cracks inside the concrete ceiling slab of the guest bathroom of a length through exact areas , cracks on the guest bathroom wall tiles allowing simultaneously an internal source of water leak (from the shower of guest bathroom of Flat 6B through to the boy's bedroom wall) etc..

In contrast to the elaborate and improbable model proposed by Mr. Ho, Mr. Wong showed the Court a much simpler and more logical scheme of how water flow from this one source of water leak (that is, the fresh water pipe burst) could account for all the water damages observed in Flat 6B. 81. Having considered all the evidence before it, the Court finds that there have been multiple sources of water leaks over time, as follows :- i) From the fresh water pipes which have accounted for the most substantial amount of damages between the period September to November 2008. ii) From the bathtub of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B including all the facilities of the bathtub including the U-trap drain etc.. iii) From the seams around the bathtub and ceramic walls of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B which has been repaired at various points of time. 82. It is not possible now to assess the exact contribution to the overall water leakage damage from bathtub and facilities and the seams around the bathtub and the ceramic walls :- i) There were evidence before the Court that various sealants and bathtub surroundings have been repaired at various times over the years. ii) Although the bathtub facilities were not replaced until July 2010, the extent of water leakage from this source would obviously be related to the actual amount of usage of the bathtub. However :- a) The earlier tenants were a couple so the likely amount of usage of the guest bathtub would be low. b) They were also advised at some point not to use the bathroom. c) Flat 7B was unoccupied between around 30 April to 1 August 2008. 83. Although the effect of condensation was observed by both experts on the bottom of the bathtub, the Court would discount this as a source of water leakage for the following reasons :- i) The experts accepted that the volume under the bathtub was limited to no more than 2 to 3 cubic metres. ii) This volume of air was relatively enclosed under the bathtub. It was self-evidently not open to the atmosphere. As such, the maximum amount of water vapour that could be contained by this volume of air would be limited. iii) Condensation could only occur where the air was in direct contact with the under surface of the bathtub. As a mostly enclosed space, there would be little air movement. Without significant air movement, only a limited amount of air would come into contact so the amount of water formed by condensation would have been far less than the maximum amount of water that the whole volume of air could hold. iv) Further, condensation would only occur at those times when there was a temperature difference between the bathtub and the enclosed volume of air underneath it, for example, when cold water was placed in the bathtub above. This would limit the time that condensation could take place. v) As such, the effect condensation could not have explained the continuous water leakage of more than 1 litre a day for around 50 days. No sound scientific model has been put forward by the experts to show that this could happen. vi) In fact, Mr. Ho agreed that if this was the extent of the water leak, it was not likely to be caused by condensation under the bathtub. vii) Therefore, any water formed by condensation could not have led to any significant water leakage or damage.", "content_summary": "法庭認定水滲漏來自多個源頭，包括淡水管道破裂、7B單位客用浴缸及其設施，以及浴缸周圍接縫。冷凝作用被排除為 significant 水滲漏源，因為受限空間和有限空氣流動導致冷凝水量不足。", "issue_summary": "確定水滲漏的具體來源及其對損害的貢獻程度。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

This was, therefore, much the same as the situation found in July 2006 between Flat 7B and Flat 6B, with the exception that the leakage was from the master bathroom and not the guest bathroom. iii) The Court has ascertained from Mr. Chow that the ceiling design of the master bathroom and the guest bathroom was much the same, that is, with the same ceiling opening under the bathtub of the flat above. iv) However, in this case, the repair work to the drainage of the bathtub was performed in the flat above, that is, at Flat 8B, and not at Flat 7B by extending the ceiling opening. v) When asked by the Court about how this could be done, Mr. Chow answer was that Flat 8B was occupied by its owner, so \"they could do anything they like\".", "content_summary": "法院詢問關於8B單位漏水到7B單位的事件，顯示類似維修情況曾在2003年發生，當時維修在上一層單位進行。周先生回應指8B單位由業主居住，可隨意處理，反映其態度不一致。", "issue_summary": "法院比較過往漏水事件，揭示被告對維修方法的雙重標準。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

In any case, at this stage, Mr. Chow and the Defendant were aware that there was a water leakage from Flat 7B and the source was believed to be from the U-trap drain. The onus was on the Defendant to investigate, locate and repair the water leak in a prompt and reasonable manner and the Defendant has clearly failed to do so. \n\n99. The consequence of this failure was that, when the substantial leakage occurred in September 2008, there was much delay and time wasted in the investigation. \n\n100. From the Management Report, Mr. Chow was informed of the water leakage on the third day after it started (22 September 2008) and yet he did not take any immediate steps in organising an inspection of Flat 7B to investigate the source. The Management could not gain access to Flat 7B until 29 September 2008, some 7 days after Mr. Chow was notified, and when considering that the water was leaking at the rate of 1 litre a day or more, this delay was unacceptable. \n\n101. In fact, Mr. Lau was still attempting to repair the drainage of the bathtub on 30 September 2008. When this did not work, Mr. Lau continued to do various tests to look for other sources of water leakages and it was only on 31 October 2008 that the decision was made to shut off the fresh water supply of Flat 7B. The water leak started to get under control after this time. \n\n102. This was some 42 days after the water leakage started. Time was wasted in the slow initial response by Mr. Chow and by Mr. Lau testing long-suspected water leak sources in a \"wild goose chase\" when such should have been investigated and repaired previously.

The Court was not in the least convinced by Mr. Chow's contention that he has done his best to solve any water leakage problem as soon as possible. Rather, the evidence showed that Mr. Chow was a selfish man who clearly placed his own (and the Defendant's) commercial interests above that of his neighbours. Further, his suggestion that he has replaced the fresh water pipe because of a mere \"suspicion\" not only contradicted the Management Report but was entirely unbelievable given Mr. Chow's reluctance to disturb his tenants all along. \n\n105. This Court has no doubt that Mr. Chow was all along aware, as found by his trusted technician Mr. Lau, that the burst fresh water pipe was the main source of the water leak. It was perhaps telling that Mr. Chow did not call Mr. Lau to give evidence but instead instructed Mr. Ho (whose opinion was plainly defective) as an expert in an attempt to \"muddy the water\". \n\n106. This Court therefore finds that the Defendant has caused a nuisance to the Plaintiffs, and has been negligent in failing to maintain and to keep in good repair the fresh water pipes and bathtub facilities including the U-trap drain.
