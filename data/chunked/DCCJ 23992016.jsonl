The 2nd plaintiff made two affirmations in these proceedings in support of the Order 14 application.  The plaintiffs’ case is essentially this.  The Ground Floor Unit is directly above the Basement.  In this regard, the 2nd plaintiff has referred to the floor plans of the ground floor and the basement floor of the Building.  The two plans do not appear to be on the same scale and no attempt has been made by the plaintiffs to align the two plans in order to show how one unit overlaps onto the other if viewed directly from above.  Nevertheless, one can readily come to the conclusion that a sizeable portion of the Ground Floor Unit is shown to be directly above the Basement if one takes certain features in the plans as reference points in comparing the plans, such as the solid pillars and the lift shafts, as pointed out by Mr Wong.\n10. In September 2015, water was first found to be leaking into the ceiling of the Basement, and the water leakage affected also the walls and flooring of the Basement.  (I pause here to note that this was about three months after the defendant’s tenant moved into the Ground Floor Unit.  It is not known exactly when the canteen started business after that.)  \n11. As there were large areas affected by the water leakage, the tenant in the Basement moved out on 1 October 2015 as the Basement was no longer fit for occupation.  Based on a review of the floor plans of the Building by a professional engaged by the plaintiffs, it transpired that the source of the water originated from the kitchen of the canteen in the Ground Floor Unit.  \n12. The plaintiffs promptly complained to the management office of the Building and soon began to engage in direct communication with the defendant by letters in which the plaintiffs explicitly referred to the water leakage as coming from the kitchen area in the Ground Floor Unit.   \n13. It certainly appears from those letters exchanged in October and November 2015 that the defendant had initially been very responsive to the plaintiffs’ letters and had been adopting a co-operative attitude and seemed genuine in its efforts in trying to resolve the issue.  Most noteworthy of those letters are the following ones from the defendant to the plaintiffs: \n (1) letter of 9 November 2015 in which the defendant stated that a visit had been made to the Ground Floor Unit in order to ascertain the leakage problem, and the defendant invited the plaintiffs to discuss the matter face-to-face; \n (2) letter of 16 November 2015 in which the defendant mentioned that he wished to make arrangement for some renovation contractor to inspect the Basement in order to decide what repair works were needed; \n (3) letter of 24 November 2015 in which the defendant made a detailed proposal to “eradicate the leakage problem” (my translation) and invited the plaintiffs to work together so that the parties could co-ordinate with each other to fix the issue.  The proposed work was to repair or seal the crack found in the ceiling of the Basement.   \n14. Not surprisingly, Mr Wong now relies on those letters to contend that the defendant had never disputed its liability.     \n15. There was then a negative turn of event which might have been triggered by the plaintiffs’ letter dated 3 December 2015.  In that letter, the plaintiffs agreed to the proposed repair work.  They then went on to demand a sum of about $137,000 from the defendant as compensation for the loss caused by the water leakage.\n16. The next letter that followed was one from the defendant.  It was noticeably a short one in which the defendant informed the plaintiffs that the matter had been referred to its insurer for further handling and follow-up.", "content_summary": "水滲漏始於2015年9月，影響地下室天花板、牆壁和地板，導致租客搬離。專業意見指水源來自地面單位食堂廚房。雙方通訊顯示被告最初合作，但後因賠償要求轉交保險公司處理。", "issue_summary": "水滲漏的來源、影響及雙方溝通過程。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "facts", "embedding_model": null}

The plaintiffs contend that the water has originated from the Ground Floor Unit. In this application, the plaintiffs have filed no expert report on the cause or potential cause of the leakage. Instead, Mr Wong invites the court to take into account the following factual matters and by deduction come to the conclusion that the Ground Floor Unit has been the source: (1) The affected part of the Basement is located next to a pump room. At the plaintiffs’ request, the management office checked the pump room and found no sign of water on either the floor or the ceiling of the pump room. (2) The leakage has been found in the middle part of the ceiling of the Basement and not its side walls. This seems to suggest that the water did not come through the side walls from above. (3) The defendant referred to a crack on the ceiling of the Basement in respect of which repair work was earlier proposed. This seems to suggest that water has been coming down from directly above through the crack and not from the side walls. (4) Directly above the leakage location is the kitchen area of the canteen operated by the defendant’s tenant.

The defendant’s stance in these proceedings can be gathered from the following documents – in the affirmation filed by the defendant at paragraph 6: “... The Plaintiffs carry the burden to establish the source of water leakage does lie within the Defendant’s property. The present case is to the contrary. The Plaintiffs have not even at all explicitly made clear to the Court and to the Defendant exactly where they believe the source be at or which part of the property they suspect to have been causing leakage. Further, such mere speculation is without any expert opinion. ...” 22. Then in paragraph 13: “It is only just that the Defendant would not be in any position to admit or deny liability in the present circumstances. Once again, the Plaintiffs have the burden to prove the source of leakage which may well be a difficult task without any expert opinion. It is my understanding that the Plaintiffs in their correspondence seem to have wrongly shifted the burden to the Defendant in identifying the source of leakage... Without any identification on the source of leakage however, the Defendant simply is in no position to admit or deny an arbitrary allegation.” 23. Mr Ngai argues in his skeleton submissions as follows. “This is an action with respect to water leakage and it is thus inherently and vastly fact sensitive. Issue of liability is determinative on findings of fact as to the source of water leakage. The only credible and reliable evidence on the origin (s) of water leakage must be the evidence of expert(s) and it must also be evidence which the Court would accept and/or find more favourable in a trial hearing.” (paragraph 18) “It is D’s position that liability is denied, in that Workshop 1C being the source of water leakage to the Basement is denied...” (paragraph 19) “The Court is invited to dismiss Ps’ summary application on the basis of serious material factual dispute and further in the absence of professional opinion to assist the Court on the issue of liability.” (paragraph 20) 24. In gist, it seems that the defendant’s submission is based on two main planks. First, the plaintiffs have failed to produce any expert evidence to show the cause of water leakage when expert evidence is the “only credible and reliable” evidence in this regard. Secondly, the plaintiffs have in any event failed to discharge their burden to prove the origin of the leakage.", "content_summary": "被告強調原告負有舉證責任證明水滲漏源，且必須提供專家證據，否則不應在簡易程序中勝訴。被告否認責任並指原告的指控屬猜測，缺乏專業意見支持。", "issue_summary": "水滲漏案件中舉證責任的分配及專家證據的必要性，影響簡易程序的適用。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

In view of how the defendant has argued the case, namely, on the basis of burden of proof and the nature of the evidence required, it is necessary to look at the general principles governing Order 14 more closely and in greater detail than is normally necessary in this kind of application. 26. The principles are well-settled. Unless otherwise stated, the following statements are extracted from Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2017: (1) Order 14 is a summary procedure. Its underlying policy is to prevent a defendant from delaying the plaintiff from obtaining judgment in a case in which the defendant clearly has no defence to the plaintiff’s claim: see paragraph 14/4/1. See also Man Earn Limited v Wing Ting Fong [1996] 1 HKC 225. This fundamental feature was emphasised by Cheung JA in Comprehensive Auto Restoration Limited v Lee Seng Siew CACV 159/2012, 30 May 2013 at paragraph 12.

The machinery of Order 14 works on the basis that if the plaintiff’s application is properly constituted, he is prima facie entitled to judgment unless the defendant shows cause to the contrary or the application is dismissed: see paragraph 14/4/1. This machinery is expressly provided for in the rules themselves: see Order 14, rules 3(1) and 4(1).", "content_summary": "這段解釋Order 14申請必須符合構成要求，包括案件屬於Order範圍且原告滿足初步要求。一旦申請 properly constituted，原告初步有權獲得判決，除非被告顯示相反理由。", "issue_summary": "Order 14申請的構成要求和舉證責任機制。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

The burden is generally considered to be of a low threshold. For instance, it is well-known that any relevant factual allegation made by the defendant needs only to be believable as opposed to “to be believed”: see, eg, Ng Shou Chun v Hung Chun San [1994] 1 HKC 155 at 158. In order to oppose an Order 14 application, the defendant’s task is to raise an arguable defence. As Ma CJHC (as he then was) put it in Toy Major Trading Company Limited v Hang Shun Plastic Toys Limited [2007] 3 HKLRD 345 at paragraph 12, the defendant is expected to demonstrate a fair probability or reasonable grounds that a bona fide defence exists. \n\n(5) The Order 14 procedure is sometimes compared to the summary procedure under Order 28, rule 4(1). The latter procedure is “akin to an application for summary judgment under O.14, but with the difference that the burden is not cast upon the defendant as in O.14. Unlike O.14 applications, the plaintiff must first justify its entitlement to summary judgment, but once this is demonstrated prima facie on the evidence, the burden falls on the defendant to show that he has a defence to the claim.”: see Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited v Twin Profit Limited [2010] 2 HKLRD 1065 at paragraph 8 per Fok J (as he then was). See also Wing Hang Bank Limited v Liu Kam Ying [2002] 2 HKC 57 at paragraphs 7 and 10, per Ma J. This comparison echoes the points made in (3) above on the machinery of Order 14, namely, that once the application is properly constituted, the burden is on the defendant to show why the case should proceed to trial.", "content_summary": "這段說明在Order 14申請中，舉證責任在被告身上，被告只需提出可審理的爭議點或合理防禦理由。並比較Order 14與Order 28的簡易程序，指出舉證責任的差異。", "issue_summary": "Order 14申請中被告的舉證責任門檻和與其他程序的比較。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

Where there are doubts, suspicions, genuine weaknesses in the plaintiff’s own case, these doubts would detract from the plaintiff’s right to summary judgment: see 268C-D. \n\n(7) It is trite that the defendant must “condescend upon particulars” and should as far as possible deal specifically with the plaintiff’s claim and affidavit and state clearly and concisely what the defence is and what facts are relied on to support this. As Ma J explained in the Toy Major case, this obligation is to ensure that where a plaintiff raises a plausible and prima facie sustainable case, a defendant can convince the court there exists a triable issue so that leave to defend is given or the application for summary judgment is dismissed: see paragraph 14/4/4.

There are two slightly unusual features in this Order 14 application. First, neither party has adduced any expert evidence on the source of the water leakage. (I should add that the fact of the water leakage at the Basement does not appear to be in dispute, according to Mr Ngai’s submissions.) That said, however, there is no authority to the effect that expert evidence must be adduced in order to resolve the issue of the cause of any water leakage, as Mr Ngai seemed also to have accepted. \n\n28. Secondly, the defendant’s defence seems to be that the burden is on the plaintiffs to prove or at least point to the cause and that since they have not done so, not least because they have not engaged any expert to comment on the cause, the defendant is in no position to admit or deny liability, as suggested by the defendant in the opposing affirmation. \n\n29. I say this is unusual because the defendant’s stance is clearly a deviation from the general principles governing Order 14 applications which I have sought to set out in some detail above based on the White Book and well-known Order 14 cases.

I am of the view that the factual matters relied on by Mr Wong form a sound and sufficient factual premise based on which the conclusion that the Ground Floor Unit was the source of the water that has been leaking into the Basement ceiling can be legitimately and reasonably deduced.   The position of the two units, the location of the water leakage, the identification of the crack on the ceiling and the lack of water leakage in nearby space or walls are all factors that the court can take into account in determining the cause.  I also consider that the fact that the water leakage occurred shortly after the canteen started business in the Ground Floor Unit and that the leakage partially improved after the renovation work in February 2016 is a relevant factor pointing to the Ground Floor Unit being the source, given that there had apparently been no previous problem of water leakage suffered or experienced by the former tenant of the Basement.  There is of course no presumption that water leaking into a flat below comes from the flat above.  See 張秀玲 對 鄭禮莊 CACV 268/1998, 9 April 1999, a case cited by both counsel.  But Mr Wong’s analysis of the case does not rest on any such presumption.  One may say that the matters relied on by the plaintiffs are not overwhelmingly conclusive factors pointing to the cause being the Ground Floor Unit.  Yet they present a positive, reasonable and well-reasoned case and thus cannot and should not be dismissed casually out of hand, as what the defendant seems to have done here.", "content_summary": "法官認為原告提出的事實基礎合理，足以推論水滲漏源頭是地面單位。水滲漏發生在食堂開始營業後，並在翻新後部分改善，這是指向源頭的相關因素。引用案例說明沒有推定水從上層單位滲漏，但原告的論點合理不應被隨意駁回。", "issue_summary": "水滲漏源頭的認定是否基於合理事實推論及案例引用。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

It may do so by attacking or challenging the plaintiffs’ own case – such as refuting, where possible, the factual matters relied on by the plaintiffs, for example, the relative positions of the two units, the existence of the ceiling crack, whether the kitchen area of the canteen is directly above that part of the ceiling where water leakage has been found.  What is remarkable in this case is that the defendant has done none of the above.  It must be borne in mind that a number of these matters are within the power of the defendant to find out.  Yet it has made no attempt to refute the factual basis from which the plaintiffs’ conclusion is drawn.  Neither has it mounted any challenge as to whether the deduction exercise gone through by the plaintiffs is a logical one.  All it has to say about the plaintiffs’ case is that it is unsupported by expert evidence and that it is for the plaintiffs to pinpoint the source of water leakage, for example, the types of pipes from which the water originated.   Mr Ngai emphasised at the hearing that a general reference to the kitchen area is not good enough.

First, as remarked above, there is no law, rule of practice or rule of evidence mandating the use of expert evidence in a water leakage case.  Ultimately, the cause of the leakage is a factual issue that will be decided by the court.  It is wrong for the defendant to say that expert evidence is the “only credible and reliable evidence” on the cause in a water leakage case, such as the present one.  Secondly, as is clear from the discussion above, in a summary judgment application (as opposed to a trial), as the plaintiffs have made out a prima facie sustainable case, the burden is on the defendant to show an arguable defence.  A bare denial is clearly insufficient.  Given the requirement for the defendant to condescend to particulars in order to meet the plaintiffs’ case (albeit to the relatively low threshold of raising an arguable defence), it would not do for the defendant to adopt the position that it does now.  In order to discharge its burden, it may have to go and carry out its own investigation and come up with other potential sources, if any.", "content_summary": "法官指出被告立場的缺陷：專家證據不是水滲漏案件的必須證據，滲漏原因是事實問題由法院決定。在簡易判決申請中，原告已建立表面合理案例，被告有責任展示可辯護的辯護，不能僅否認，可能需要自行調查其他潛在源頭。", "issue_summary": "專家證據在水滲漏案件中的必要性及被告在簡易判決中的負擔。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

Yet the defendant has taken no step at all effectively to discharge this burden by, for example, challenging the plaintiffs’ own case, factual or otherwise, or putting up any potential defence.
