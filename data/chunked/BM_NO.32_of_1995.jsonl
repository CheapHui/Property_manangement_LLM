I could see that the conflict of evidence will aggravate the relationship of the parties and possibly split the residents of the building estate into factions when one or other witnesses would eventually be held to have in effect lied in court or not acted in accordance with acceptable moral standards in the management of the affairs of the applicant. Also in consideration of the time needed to hear witnesses in this cases which could have been profitably used for other cases, I suggested to the parties that perhaps the case can be decided on strict legal principles so that any cause lost can be attributed to purely technical grounds; that way, the parties concerned, extending to those in court and outside court, as neighbours and fellow residents within the building estate can repair relations. Consequently, counsel for the parties made submissions on preliminary points of law which may, perhaps, dispose of the case without hearing further evidence.  As I see it, and as counsel in their submission have argued, there are three crucial preliminary points. The first is whether the resolution allegedly passed at the meeting was valid as a matter of procedure. The second is whether the respondent could properly be appointed and remunerated under section 18(2) (c) of the Ordinance.", "content_summary": "法官建議基於法律原則處理案件，以避免證據衝突影響居民關係。案件聚焦於三個初步法律問題，包括決議程序有效性及報酬合法性。", "issue_summary": "決議的程序有效性及報酬任命是否合法。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "procedural_history", "embedding_model": null}

(Emphasis added) I think one must distinguish (1) the powers and duties of the corporation which are corporate in nature, (2) the powers and duties of the management committee which are collective in nature, and (3) the powers and duties of each member of the management committee which are personal in nature. There must be numerous instances where the performance of duties of a member of the management committee is also the discharge of the duties of the corporation or the management committee. However, there are also instances where the act of a member of the management committee cannot be treated as a corporate act or collective act.

Of the 'settling management fees invoices, serving notices of meetings of Committee members, drafting letters, employee appointment contracts, house rules, all typing works, minutes of meetings, and circulars from time to time' done or to be done by Arch Link, I find that settling management fees invoices, serving notices of meetings of management committee, drafting letters and typing work, all purely secretarial or clerical duties, cannot possibly be regarded in law as powers and duties of the corporation. It follows that the contracting out of these duties cannot come under section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance. It is not clear what 'employee appointment contracts, house rules, minutes of meetings, and circulars from time to time' means. Assuming 'employee appointment contracts, house rules, minutes of meetings and circulars from time to time' come under powers and duties of the corporation, they are mixed with, and thus degraded by, purely secretarial or clerical duties that I do not think they should be isolated for the purpose of justifying remuneration under section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance.", "content_summary": "秘書維持業主登記冊的職責是個人職責。具體職務如處理管理費發票、會議通知、書信草擬等純粹秘書或文書職責，不屬於法團的權力與職責，因此外包這些職務不適用第18(2)(c)條。", "issue_summary": "具體職務是否屬於法團的權力與職責及第18(2)(c)條的適用性。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

It is said that it would be unfair to expect committee members to provide service on statutory allowance in all cases irrespective of the workload. I should think 'allowance' in section 18(2)(aa) in contradistinction to 'remunerate' in section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance very well illustrates the nature of payment to management committee members. Members of a management committee should not expect remuneration fully commensurate with the market value of their work. Their work in the committee is a kind of public service. The Ordinance already tries to be fair by setting different levels of allowances for estates with different number of units. See the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance.
