The estate comprises of three residential blocks and \none commercial complex.   The second applicant (“ the Manager”)  is the \nmanger appointed under the deed of mutual covenants.  The first applicant is \nthe first owner and was the developer of the estate. The first applicant and \nthe manager are associated companies.  At a meeting of owners    held on 6 \nOctober 1995, two resolutions were passed, one  to form the management \ncommittee, and the other to incorporate the owners..  The validity of both  \nresolutions was challenged by the  first applicant.  It took out an application \nin this tribunal (BM 158 of 1995) to have the resolutions declared void.  For \nreasons best known to the parties,  that application was not pursued \ndiligently and after some delay the Land Registrar eventually issued the \nrequisite certificate of registration for the incorporation of the owners on 12 \nMay 1997.   \n\nOn 24 April 1997,  the first applicant  together with  th ree other owners \nissued a request to the chairman of the management committee for a meeting \nfor the purpose of dissolving the management committee and appointing an \nadministrator in its place.  The first applicant then owned 204 shares.  The \naggregate of s hares of those who requested the meeting  amounted to 3626 \nshares which exceeded 5% of the total of 16500 shares into which the estate \nwas divided into. No meeting was convened by the chairman.  On 16 May \n1997 and after the Land Registrar issued the certif icate of registration, the \nsame four owners re -issued the request to the chairman for a meeting to be \nconvened for the same purposes. \n\nOn 30 May 1997,  the chairman on legal advice rejected the request on the \nground that the number of owners,  being four,  did not constitute not less \nthan 5% of the total number of the owners.  On 12 June 1997 the first \napplicant took out the present proceedings seeking, inter alia,  an mandatory \ninjunction   compelling the chairman to convene a meeting in accordance \nwith their request of 16 May.   \n\nOn 10 June 1997, owners of  forty six flats made a request to the chairman \nfor a meeting for the purposes of terminating the contract with the manager \nand appointing another in its place.   The total number of shares they then \nowned was 645 and was less than 5% of the total of 16500 shares.  \nNevertheless the management committee complied with the request and \nissued a notice for the meeting to be held on 1 August 1997.  On 15 July\n\n3 \n1997, the management issued another notice of  the s ame meeting  only this \ntime it was included in the notice that the meeting was also convened \npursuant to the resolution of  the management committee on 6 June 1997.   \n\nOn 24 July, the applicants applied to this tribunal for an injunction \nrestraining the re spondents from convening the meeting on 1 August.  The \napplication was unsuccessful and the meeting was held as scheduled on 1 \nAugust.   At the meeting resolutions were passed to terminate the contract of \nthe second applicant and to appoint another in its place.   The applicants \ncontended that certain  proxies of corporate owners were not under seal and \nshould not be counted.  Without the votes of these proxies, the resolution \nterminating the contract would not be carried as the statutory minimum of \n50% of the shares was not reached.   They also contended  that the meeting \nwas not properly convened because the requisition for a meeting was not \nmade by owners of 5% of  the shares and that the resolutions passed at the \nmeeting were null and void.  At the hearing   the applicants were given leave \nto re-amend their applications to include these causes of actions which only \narose on 1 August 1997.", "content_summary": "案件背景涉及葵芳臺業主立案法團的成立，申請人挑戰會議決議有效性，並多次請求解散管理委員會。管理委員會以業主人數不足5%為由拒絕會議請求，但後來又召開會議通過終止管理合約的決議。申請人質疑會議召開的合法性和代理人文書的有效性。", "issue_summary": "業主會議請求的合法性及管理委員會決定的爭議，涉及業主百分比計算和會議程序。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "facts", "embedding_model": null}

The literal meaning of 5% of the owners must refer to the number of owners and not the share they own in aggregate. By sections 2 and 39 the owners' identities are documented and physical numbers can be ascertained. The only possible absurdity or ambiguity arises when we determine the legal meaning of total number of owners. Should a mortgagor and a mortgagee in possession of the same share be counted as two or as one? In the case of joint ownership of an undivided share, should the count of owners be as many as there are joint owners or just one? It would be absurd to count every co-owners.

Indeed elsewhere in the Ordinance, whenever % of ownership is referred to, it is referred to as owners of x% of the shares. Such interpretation would certainly make the various parts of the Ordinance and schedules more consistent with each other. The question is what is the intent of the legislature. The court should not try to improve the legislation when interpreting a difficult part of the Ordinance. It must try its utmost to give effect to the legislative intent. If the legislature intended the words \"5% of the owners\" to mean \"owners of 5% of the shares\", it would simply use those words as it did in other sections and schedules. Not much, if any, in economy of words or improvement of style is gained in using a different expression to mean the same thing. I am not convinced that it was the legislative intent that \"5% of the owners\" means \"owners of 5% of the shares.\" The legislative intent was clear from the Ordinance itself and from the words used. The Chinese text which is not a translation but is equally authentic. Mr. James To's remarks in the Legislative Council is of little assistance.

Section 2 provides that an owner must own an undivided share. The size of this undivided share varies from owner to owner and section 39 acknowledges this. In the instant case a typical small flat owner owns 12 shares. The total number of shares the estate is divided into is 16500. The size of this owner's undivided share is therefore 12/16500. If he acquires another flat, his undivided share would increase in size, for example, to 24/16500 . However he would be counted only once in the determining the total number of owners for the time being despite the increase in size of his undivided share . What happens in this case is two undivided shares merge into one. The converse situation takes place when a developer starts to sell off his units. At the very early stage he owns the whole lot of the land. When he sells a flat to the first buyer, he would only retain a share of the land and the balance goes to the first buyer. After this first sale there would be two owners each owning an undivided share of unequal sizes in the land. As the developer continues to sell off his flats, his undivided shares diminishes in size while the total number of undivided shares so created increases. In the case of co-ownership of an undivided share, they would be collectively counted as one owner toward the total number of owners. The total number of owners envisaged in the third schedule must be the same as the total number of undivided shares .
