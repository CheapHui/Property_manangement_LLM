The following is considered a fair summary of the agenda requested by the applicants in the 1st request: i) To over-rule the resolutions passed at the 2013 August meeting; ii) To replace all newly -elected management committee members; and iii) To replace the cleaning contractor of the housing estate. On 21st September 2013, a management committee meeting of the Incorporated Owners was convened to discuss the 1 st request. It was resolved, inter alia, that: i) no owners meeting would be convened despite the 1st request; and ii) The 2 nd respondent was authorized to lodge an application with this tribunal. From the meeting minutes disclosed, it is fair to say that the Incorporated Owners considered it troublesome to convene another owners meeting shortly after the 2013 August meetings, particularly in light the Police was still investigating into the complaints. It would therefore be too early, considered by the Incorporated Owners, to say the 2013 August meeting invalid. The 2nd respondent was authorized to make application to the tribunal on behalf of the Incorporated Owners , presumably to confirm the validity of the 2013 August meeting. It was noted from the said meeting minutes that neither the 2nd respondent nor other members of the said management committee had ever queried the1st request not meeting the 5% statutory threshold. Three days later on 24 th September 2013, the Incorporated Owners made the present original application to this tribunal against the two applicants for, inter alia, that the 2013 August meeting was validly convened; and that they are entitled not to convene owners meeting even on receipt of the 1 st request.

Section 8(5) of the Building Management Ordinance, Cap 344 ( “BMO”) provides that Schedule 3 thereof shall have effect with respect to the meetings and procedure of a corporation. Paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 3 of BMO stipulates that: “The chairman of the management committee shall convene a general meeting of the corporation at the request of not less than 5% of the owners for the purposes specified by such owners within 14 days of receiv ing such request, and hold the general meeting within 45 days of receiving such request.” 25. The aforesaid provision imposes a statutory duty on the chairman of the management committee to convene an owners meeting upon receipt of a request from 5% owners for the pur poses specified therein. In the tribunal’s judgment, the word “shall”, which normally denotes a mandatory requirement, is used. It is a strict statutory requirement. Once the evidence of not less than 5% owners of the corporation supporting such r equest is shown 3, the chairman has little alternative but to convene the meeting as required of him statutorily. He simply has no discretion in the circumstances. It is not for him or the corporation to say that there have been too many EGM s recently or th at the request causes too much trouble to the corporation. The chairman also cannot hide behind any resolution of a management committee or even the corporation for the simple reason it is the statutory provision that is to prevail. Neither is the validity of a prior general meeting relevant as the requirement to hold meeting is not hinged on any pre -condition. Regardless of whether the 2013 August meeting valid or not, once a 5% request was received, a general meeting must be convened in accordance with Schedule 3. 26. In the tribunal’s view , the procedure and requirements of Schedule 3 are for the protection of owners so t hat owners of the same corporation can manage their own affairs in a transparent, fair and democratic manner. Although much can be said on whether the 5% threshold is too low or just acceptable, unless and until the same is altered, it remains the consensus when the said statutory requirement went through the legislature. If the majority of owners disapprove any of the proposals in the reques t, they can simply vote it down. Obviously there will be substantial internal dissipation if the corporation is divided.

However, no matter it is 20th April or 4th May 2014, the applicants still had a good case when they filed the counterclaim on 11th April, 2014. Further, in light of what has been discussed above regarding the 1st request, it will be difficult for the 2nd respondent to say that the applicants should not therefore pursue the 1st request, though given the outcome of the May 4th EGM, the possibility of another defeat might well be anticipated. It would therefore be unnecessary to deal with the 1st request further in light of the defeat of 2nd request. In any event, as it is the 2nd respondent’s position that the 1st request would not be entertained, in the tribunal’s view, the applicants have a fairly strong case to proceed against the 2nd respondent for his apparent breach of §1(2) of Schedule 3 of BMO.", "content_summary": "法院認為無論如何，申請人在提交反申索時針對第二次請求有良好訴因。儘管5月4日EGM後追討第一次請求可能不划算，但申請人針對第二答辯人違反附表3第1(2)條仍有強烈理據。", "issue_summary": "爭點在於申請人的訴訟是否在提交時有合理基礎，儘管後續事件影響其必要性。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}
