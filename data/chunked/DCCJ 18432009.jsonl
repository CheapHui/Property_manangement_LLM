IPM suspected the water leakage had probably originated from Flat 5A and asked him to turn off the valve inside the guest bathroom at Flat 5A to suspend the fresh water supply to the guest bathroom. He did so, but was informed the condition at Flat 4A did not abate. On 27 July 2008, at the suggestion of IPM, the fresh water supply to Flat 5A was shut down during the daytime. However, the water leakage problem at Flat 4A did not stop. Mr. Kam found the water marks on the walls of Flat 5A still remained. On 29th July, the staff of IPM informed him that the situation at Flat 4A was deteriorating and suggested shutting down the fresh water supply at Flat 5A entirely for most of the day leaving only a couple of hours during the morning and evening for water supply to Flat 5A. He complied with the request, but was informed that in spite of the shut down of the fresh water supply to Flat 5A, Flat 4A’s leakage problem had continued, he also found the water marks on the walls of Flat 5A had remained. Mr. Kam therefore suspected the source of water leakage to Flat 4A did not originate from the fresh water supply to Flat 5A. On 30 July 2008, at the request of Mr. Leung of Flat 4A, he allowed Mr. Chan to inspect Flat 5A to investigate the cause of leakage into Flat 4A. Mr. Chan told him the water leakage was caused by the under floor fresh water pipe at Flat 5A running from the guest bathroom through the living room into the kitchen. Mr. Chan also told him that the design of the building had such a fresh water pipe installed under the floor to supply hot water to the kitchen. On 1 August 2008, Mr. Kam found a pool of water on the window sill in the living room, as water was running continuously from the window sill, he immediately reported it to the management office. After Mr. Leung and Mr. Chan inspected Flat 5A on 2 August 2008, Mr. Chan insisted the water leakage at Flat 5A was caused by the fresh water pipe under the living room floor.

Consequently, the original fresh water supply pipe was abandoned before Mr. Kam became a resident of Flat 5A.
