The action arises out of an agreement made on 7th October 1991 for the sale by the defendant to the plaintiff of Flat E, 12th Floor, Forward Mansion, Tuen Mun. The sale price was $800,000, which both sides accept was an undervalue. The agreement contains a number of terms in standard form, but it also contains several exceptional provisions to which I now refer. First, the amount of the deposit paid by the plaintiff to the defendant under the terms of the agreement was $400,000, 50% of the purchase price. This, of course, is greatly in excess of the conventional 10%, and immediately causes one to raise one's eyebrows. Secondly, the date fixed for completion of the agreement is a date, 7th October 1992, one year later than the date of the agreement itself; and one's eyebrows rise further. Thirdly, it contains a provision the effect of which is that the defendant was to be entitled at any time to call the sale off on 7 days' notice in writing to the plaintiff on repayment to the plaintiff of the $400,000 without compensation, interest or costs; and one's eyebrows rise into the stratosphere.", "content_summary": "案件涉及原告上訴，原審法官在簡易判決申請中給予被告無條件辯護權。行動源於1991年10月7日的房地產買賣協議，出售屯門Forward Mansion 12樓E室，售價80萬港元，雙方同意是低估。協議包含標準條款及多項異常條款，包括50%定金、一年後完成日期、被告可隨時取消銷售等。", "issue_summary": "爭議點在於買賣協議的性質是否真實，還是實際上是貸款協議。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "facts", "embedding_model": null}

But the defendant says, first, the transaction never took place at all; he never received the $400,000.Second, he says that in considering the transaction, the court should look at the substance and not the form and should conclude that it was in reality a transaction for the loan of $400,000, the property standing by way of security for repayment of that sum.

On this point, that is to say, whether the $400,000 was ever received by the defendant at all, I would accept the submission of Mr Whitehead that that assertion is incredible. In National Westminster Bank Plc v. Daniel, 19th February 1993 (unreported), Glidewell L.J. said this : \"I think it right to follow the words of Ackner LJ in the Banque de Paris case - or indeed these which amount to much the same thing (as I see it) of Lloyd LJ in the Standard Chartered Bank case. 'Is there a fair or reasonable probability of the defendants' having a real or bona fide defence'? Lloyd LJ posed the test: 'Is what the defendant says credible?' If it is not, then there is no fair or reasonable probability of him setting up a defence.\" I would apply that test to the defendant's assertion about the $400,000 here. In the local case of Bhagwandas Kewaleram Murjani & Others v. Bank of India [1990]1 HKLR 586, the Court of Appeal, after going into all the evidence, came to the conclusion that the case of the defendant was plainly advanced dishonestly and was therefore incredible. But Murjani was decided before National Westminster Bank v. Daniel and I would sound a note of caution about Murjani, which has come to be cited in almost every case under 0.14 or 0.86 to justify the plaintiff in asking the court to embark on a mini-trial of the action on affidavit evidence. That is not a proper course for the court to take. It will in future be sufficient for the court to ask itself the simple question :\" Is what the defendant says credible?\" If so, he must have leave to defend. If not, the plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment. The issue is, not whether the defendant's assertions are to be believed; it is whether those assertions are believable. Having said that, I repeat that the defendant's assertion in this case that he never received the $400,000 is in my view beyond belief and if the matter had rested there I would have allowed the appeal.", "content_summary": "法院認為被告聲稱未收到40萬港元的證據不可信，引用 National Westminster Bank v.

There remain the defendant's two other points to be considered. As to the defendant's second point, he is right in contending that equity looks at the substance of the transaction, not the form. There are many cases in the books where a sale, with a collateral agreement for repurchase by the vendor within a stipulated time. has been held by the courts to be. in essence. a transaction by way of mortgage. The undervalue, and highly unusual provisions of the agreement here, suggest that this was just such a transaction. It will be for the trial judge to decide what evidence he accepts and what evidence he rejects But the circumstances seem to me, on the face of it, to be consistent more with a transaction by way of charge to secure the repayment of the $400,000 than with a genuine transaction of sale and purchase. (Nothing I say is, of course, intended to pre-empt any decision of the trial judge, who will have the advantage which we have not of seeing and hearing the witnesses.)

In his short judgment, the judge below said \"It is indeed the case that if the defendant's evidence is considered on its merits, his defence is not very convincing.\" With that, for my part, I agree. In particular, it is my view on the affidavits that have been put before the Court that his contention that he did not received the $400,000 is incredible. Of course that in no way binds any other tribunal which considers the point. But, in 0.86 proceedings for summary judgment, that is not the end of the matter. The defendant raises the issue that in any event the transaction was not that which it appears, and on this point the plaintiff is in difficulties on his own case. The issue is : was it an agreement for the sale and purchase of this flat; or was it, in truth, the loan of $400,000 with the agreement that there should be a charge on the flat as security. Suffice it to say that for the reasons given already, the nature of the transaction, the correspondence, the history, and the nature of the plaintiff's claim as initially made, show that there is an issue to be tried, and that the case ought to go for trial as the judge decided. I agree with what has fallen from Godfrey J.A. on the proper approach to affidavit evidence in 0.14 and 0.86 proceedings and the futility of holding lengthy hearings in them. So far as the Moneylenders Ordinance and the defence sought to be raised by amendment is concerned, for my part, I would not make it any part of my reasoning for dismissing this appeal. I can see that it may fall for argument in future cases where there is an application for summary judgment on the loan of money, and the defendant seeks to raise a defence under the Moneylenders Ordinance in the hope that he may obtain some evidence which supports his defence by the administration of interrogatories following Nash v. Layton [1911]2 Ch 71. That is a matter which may fall for argument in the future. I would not make it any part of my reasons for dismissing this appeal.", "content_summary": "第三位法官同意駁回上訴，認為被告聲稱未收款項不可信，但交易性質爭議需審判釐清。他強調簡易判決程序不應進行冗長聽訊，並對放債人條例辯護持保留態度。", "issue_summary": "交易性質爭議是駁回上訴的主要理由，放債人條例辯護不作為決定依據。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}
