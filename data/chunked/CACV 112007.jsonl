Without dealing with every single one of the toys, I note the following by way of example: \n(i) a dorsal fin on a dinosaur ha s precisely the same number of points on each item, even to the extent of an exact reproduction of a notch point.   The facial expression on each is identical; these items are identical on the clay model;\n(ii) the head of each whale has precisely the same number of spots, nine, and they are in precisely the same location on each fish; these items are identical on the clay model; \n(iii) the fin positions and style, and facial expression on the seals are identical, just as they are on the clay model; \n(iv) the facial expression, location of spots, chest plates, and arm positions on a dinosaur are precisely identical, the only difference being the angle of the tail position; \n(v) the number of spines, and plates, the style of the spines on a dinosaur, and the tail angle are precisely identical, the only difference being the angle of the head; \n(vi) the facial expression, location and design of wrinkles and mouth style of a long neck dinosaur are precisely identical, the only difference being the angle of the head. \nIn all respects Hang Shun’s products match the clay models with only minor differences such as head or tail position.   The similarity between the clay sculptures and Hang Shun’s finished products is so striking as to lead overwhelmingly to the conclusion tha t Toy Major’s products have been copied to a very substantial extent.”\n\nIn addition, the judge noted the similarity in the names used by the Plaintiff and the Defendant for their products (respectively “Squeeze Me!

This is correct.  The judge found on the evidence that the Defendant was the manufacturer of the relevant products and that this fact therefore gave rise to the strong inference that the Defendant knew about the Plaintiff ’s products (the striking similarities between the two products could not have been coincidences).  The issue of the Defendant being the manufacturer as a relevant factor going towards knowledge was expressly pleaded in the Statement of Claim and specifically denied in the Re-amended Defence and Counterclaim.  In the affidavit evidence produced by the Plaintiff for the summary judgment proceedings (from an investigator), reference was made to a staff member of the Defendant (one Ms K K Lam) having told the investigator that the Defendant did manufacture animal figurines (of which samples, which bore similarities to the Plaintiff’s products, had earlier been provided).  She told the investigator that the figurines were manufactured at the Defendant’s factory in Shenzhen.  This factory or a factory was specificall y referred in the Defendant ’s catalogues and website as a 7,000 sq ft factory in Shenzhen which employed 400 workers.  Ms Lam’s name  card refers to the Defendant’ s “China Factory” and provides a Shenzhen address. 11. Against this evidence that the Defendant wa s the manufacturer of the relevant goods, the Defendant made a bare denial that it manufactured the products.  Nothing however was said about the source of its products (even though the affirmation from a director of the Defendant stated that many animal f igurines were manufactured by “other” traders).  No details were vouchsafed to meet the Plaintiff’s evidence, much less any documents provided that even hinted at the fact that the Defendant was not a manufacturer but merely a trader.  The judge commented on the lack of particulars given by the Defendant.  He said this : - “29. The evidence that Hang Shun were the manufacturer of the offending items is clear, and, short of a bare denial there is no evidence to the contrary.  When regard is had to the startl ing similarity between the items produced by Toy Major and Hang Shun, the overwhelming inference is that Hang Shun had in their possession products made by Toy Major when making their own products.  It is simply unarguable the precise similarities arising in the nature of particular spots, numbers of scales, wrinkles on skin and the like could have occurred purely by coincidence.  They could only have occurred through direct copying.”", "content_summary": "本段討論被告作為製造商的證據，包括員工陳述和工廠資訊，以及產品相似性如何推斷被告知曉原告產品。法官指出被告僅作空洞否認，未能提供細節反駁證據。", "issue_summary": "法律爭點在於簡易判決程序中，被告是否有義務提供具體細節來顯示可審判的爭議。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

Mr Liao has tried this morning (as well as in his written submissions) to explain just why the Defendant had failed to condescend to particulars.

With respect, as poin ted out earlier, this was clearly pleaded in the Statement of Claim and Mr Liao readily accepts this.  I cannot agree with the points that have been made by the Defendant.  In my view, the Defendant’s evidence goes nowhere near the obligation on a defendan t in summary judgment proceedings to condescend to particulars.  This obligation is to ensure that where a plaintiff raises a plausible and prima facie sustainable case, a defendant can convince the court there exists a triable issue so that leave to defen d is given or the application for summary judgment is dismissed.
