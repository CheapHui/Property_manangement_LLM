The OC has thus passed a resolution that \nall its agents including members of the MC and the sub-committees and employees should \nobserve this Code when conducting business for the OC.\nPrevention of Bribery Ordinance\n(2) \n Any agent of the OC soliciting or accepting an advantage in connection with his work for \nthe OC without the permission of the OC will commit an offence under Section 9(1) and \nthe offeror of the advantage will commit an offence under Section 9(2) of the Prevention of \nBribery Ordinance (POBO) (Cap 201). The term “advantage”, as defined in the Ordinance \nincludes money, gift, loan, fee, reward, employment, contract, service and favour but does \nnot include entertainment which is the provision of food or drink for consumption on the \noccasion.\n(3) \n Any agent of the OC using any false documents, records, accounts or receipts with the intent \nto deceive the OC will commit an offence under Section 9(3) of the POBO.\nAcceptance of Advantage\n(4) \n The OC has passed a resolution that agents of the OC are not allowed to solicit or accept \nany advantage in relation to the business of the OC, unless with the prior permission of the \nOC in writing. Examples include MC members not to accept gifts from contractors and \ncaretakers not to solicit tips from owners and tenants.\nEntertainment\n(5) \n Although entertainment is not an advantage and is an acceptable form of social and \nbusiness activity, agents of the OC should avoid accepting lavish or frequent entertainment \nfrom business associates of the OC (e.g. contractors or sub-contract", "CATERGORY": "實務指引", "SCTION_TYPE": "節"}

Excessive gambling and \nloans should also be avoided.\nAnnex 6 — Page 1\nConﬂ ict of Interest\n(6) \n A conflict of interest arises when the private interest of an agent of the OC competes or \nconﬂ icts with the interest of the OC. Private interest includes both the ﬁ nancial and personal \ninterest of the agent and those of his connections. Connections include his family members, \nrelatives and close personal friends.\n(7) \n Agents of the OC should avoid any situation which may lead to an actual or perceived \nconﬂ ict of interest and make a declaration to the MC or the OC when such a situation arises. \nExamples include an MC member holding the shares of a contractor bidding for the OC’s \ncontract, and a caretaker being a relative of his supervisor. Failing to declare or avoid conﬂ ict \nof interest may give rise to criticism of favouritism, abuse of authority or even allegation of \ncorruption.\nHandling Conﬁ dential Information and Accounts\n(8) \n Agents of the OC should not disclose any conﬁ dential information (e.g. tender price, personal \ndata etc.) of the OC without authorization and should take the necessary measures to protect \nsuch information from being abused or misused. \n(9) \n Agents should ensure the documents, accounts and receipts submitted to the OC are true \nand accurate.\nCompliance with Code of Conduct\n(10) It is the responsibility of the agents of the OC to understand and comply with this Code.
