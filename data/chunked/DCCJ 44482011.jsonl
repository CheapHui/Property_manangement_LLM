Before me are two applications for leave to appeal from both parties in respect of my judgment handed down on 20 April 2015 (the “Judgment”) and an application from the plaintiff to vary the costs order nisi which I had made in the Judgment.\n\n2.      This is a water leakage claim transferred from the Small Claim Tribunal.  The parties are property owners of flats in Tower 1 (the “Building”) of Greenheight Villa (the “Estate”) at Shatin Heights Road, Tai Wai, Shatin, New Territories.\n\n3.      The plaintiff is and was at the material times owner of unit C at the first floor of the Building (“Flat 1C”).\n\n4.      The defendants are and were at the material times owners of unit C at the second floor of the Building ( “Flat 2C”) and part of the roof immediately above Flat 2C (together “Ds’ Flat”).\n\n5.      Flat 2C was located immediately above Flat 1C.\n\n6.      The plaintiff claimed that in the early morning of 19 July 2009, there was serious water seepage from Ds ’ Flat into Flat 1C (the “2009 Incident”) causing damage to the ceiling paper and wallpaper of Flat 1C.\n\n7.      The plaintiff claimed that it had spent $18,000 on replacing ceiling paper and $46,700 on replacing wallpaper  damaged in the 2009 Incident.  After the replacement, it was later found that there was further and frequent water seepage from Ds ’ Flat into Flat 1C (the “Water Leakage”) causing damage to Flat 1C and rental loss to the plaintiff.\n\n8.      The plaintiff claimed that because of the Water Leakage, the then tenant of Flat 1C (Miss Suen Wai Ling ie “PW1”) did not renew the tenancy after its expiration on 26 October 2010 and the plaintiff was unable to secure a new tenant until July 2013.  Thus suffering loss of rental for about 33 months at $18,000 per month.\n\n9.      The plaintiff claimed that both the 2009 Incident and the Water Leakage were caused by the defendants’ negligence and/or nuisance.\n\n10.      The plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages against the defendants.\n\n11.      In the Judgment, I found the defendants liable for the 2009 Incident and for the Water Leakage.  I found that the defendants were liable to pay $48,000 to the plaintiff as damages for the 2009 Incident and to pay $7,800 to the plaintiff as damages for the Water Leakage.  The total amount of damages payable by the defendants to the plaintiff was $ 55,800.  I disallowed the plaintiff’s claim for loss of rental.\n\n12.      I also granted the injunctive relief sought by the plaintiff and ordered the defendants to carry out repair works to Flat 2C to stop further seepage of water from Flat 2C into Flat 1C.", "content_summary": "案件背景涉及住宅單位的水滲漏問題，原告指控被告疏忽和滋擾導致財產損壞及租金損失。原判決判定被告對部分損害負責，賠償金額為55,800港元，但駁回租金損失索賠，並發出禁令要求被告進行維修。", "issue_summary": "爭議點在於被告是否對水滲漏負有法律責任，以及租金損失是否可獲賠償。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "facts", "embedding_model": null}

Both parties seek leave to appeal against my different rulings in the Judgment pursuant to section 63A of the District Court Ordinance (Cap 336).  Section 63A(2) provides that:\n\n“(2) Leave to appeal shall not be granted unless the judge, the master or the Court of Appeal hearing the a pplication for leave is satisfied that ─\n\n (a) the appeal has a reasonable prospect of success; or\n\n (b) there is some other reason in the interests of justice why the appeal should be heard.”\n\n15.

Mr Leung submitted that I erred in putting excessive weight on the valuation report of Ds’ Valuer. He contended that the valuation report of Ds’ Valuer was fundamentally flawed for the following reasons: (1) The comparables adopted by Ds’ Valuer were not information available to the open market and it was wrong in concept for Ds’ Valuer to rely on such information as comparables for determining the open market rental of Flat 1C. (2) The valuation estimated by D s’ Valuer was so m uch detached from the real market and, as such, should have been rejected. (3) The market rent (inclusive of rates and management fees) for Flat 1C as on 27 September 2005 was $13,500, and that on 27 September 2006 was $14,000. Starting from 27 October 2007, it was $15,600 (without car park). (4) According to the Rating and Valuation Department the rateable value of Flat 1C had increased by about 12% from 27 October 2007 to 27 October 2010. There was no reason why the real market for Flat 1C did not respond to that increase. (5) Ds’ Valuer’s valuation of the market rental for Flat 1C as on 27 October 2010 was about 14% below the real market rental in 2007 and about 28% below the rental projected from the historical figures for Flat 1C. (6) Ds’ Valuer’s valuation for F lat 1C as on 26 October 2012 was $15,900 (inclusive of rates and management fees and car park) which was almost the same as the real rental as on 27 October 2007 (without car park), ie $15,600. The rateable value for Flat 1C had increased from $127,000 as on 27 October 2007 to $177,000 as on 26 October 2012 (about 39%). Applying the same percentage increase, the market rental for Flat 1C as on 26 October 2012 should be around $21,684 (without car park). (7) Ds’ Valuer’s valuation was patently unreliable and should not be relied on for any proper purpose. (8) Ds’ Valuer should have made reference to the agreed historical rental for Flat 1C and applied a time adjustment factor which should be the most accurate method in estimating the rental value of Flat 1C. (9) Three of the four comparables adopted by Ds ’ Valuer were transactions occurred after 27 October 2010. 33. I had dealt with the parties ’ expert evidence on rental value of Flat 1C in paras 181 to 210 of the Judgment and I had dealt with the plaintiff’s loss of rental claim in paras 275 to 282 of the Judgment. I do not propose to repeat myself here. 34. Mr Leung commented that the comparables adopted by Ds ’ Valuer were not information available to the open market and the rental values of these four transa ctions had not influenced the open market. He submitted that it was wrong in concept for Ds ’ Valuer to rely on such information as “comparables” for determining the open market rental of Flat 1C. 35. I do not quite follow this submission of Mr Leung on “open market”. A transaction was a transaction in the market (ie a market transaction) irrespective of whether the transaction information was made available to the public. A comparable is a market transaction in similar type of property, particulars of which after appropriate adjustments will provide referencing information assisting the expert to form his opinion on the market value (in our case the market rental value) of the property concerned. It needs not be a transaction influencing the market. A comparable is simply a transaction in the market.", "content_summary": "法院討論上訴理由2，涉及專家評估市場租金的可靠性，原告質疑估值報告的比較單位和公開市場概念。這與滲水導致的租金損失索賠相關，法院強調市場交易無需公開即可作為比較基準。", "issue_summary": "法律爭點在於專家證據的權重和市場租金評估方法的合理性。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

When Mr Leung criticized the valuation estimated by Ds’ Valuer as “so much detached from the real market ”, he had in mind a “real market rental value” for Flat 1C. If there was a “real market rental value” for Flat 1C, it would not be necessary for the parties to adduce expert evidence on market rental value of Flat 1C. \n\n37. Mr Leung calculated the “real market value” of Flat 1C as at 27 October 2010 at $17,472 using the rent paid by PW1 as on 27 October 2007 (ie $15,600) and the increase in rateable values of Flat 1C from 27 October 2007 to 27 October 2010 (ie about 12%). Mr Leung contended that if the same percentage of increase was applied to estimate the market rental of Flat 1C as on 27 October 2010, it would have been $17,472 (without car park). \n\n38. With respect, I am of the view that Mr Leung had over-simplified the exercise of property valuation. If the actual rent paid by PW1 was the “ real market rent ” for Flat 1C and the “real market rent ” for Flat 1C could be ascertained by the formula proposed by Mr Leung, the rent paid by PW1 for Flat 1C would not have been increased from $13,500 as on 27 September 2005 to $14,000 as on 27 September 2006 when the rateable value of Flat 1C had remained unchanged from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007. \n\n39. In any event, the “real market rental” for Flat 1C “found” by Mr Leung using his above formula was $17,472 (inclusive of rates and management fees but without car park) as on 27 October 2010. This does not assist the plaintiff. The asking rent of the plaintiff for Flat 1C after moving out of PW1 on 26 October 2010 was $25,000.

We are now in the post-CJR era. The court’s approach to costs after the CJR was discussed in Chan Mei Yiu, Paddy & Ors v Secretary for Justice & Ors (unrep., HCAL 16/2007, 9 December 2010) when Saunders J stated that: “5. However, I accept Mr McCoy’s submission that the proper approach to costs, having regard to the changes brought about by civil justice reform, is that the proposition that costs follow the event is not a general rule, but only operates to shift to the unsuccessful party the burden of showing why some different approach should be adopted on the facts of a particular case. When regard is had to the provisions of O 62 R 5(1) [of the Rules of the High Court]: “The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs shall, to such extent, if any, as may be appropriate in the circumstances take into account – (aa) the underlying objectives set out in Order 1A, rule 1; (e) the conduct of all parties; (f) whether a party has succeeded on part of his case, even if he has not been wholly successful,” it becomes abundantly apparent that the dictum of Lord Lloyd of Berwick in Bolton MBC v Enc Sec (Practice Note) [1995] 1 WLR 1176 at 1178 more properly reflects the approach to costs: “As in all questions to do with costs, the fundamental rule is that there are no rules. Costs are always in the discretion of the court, and a practice, however, widespread and long standing, must never be allowed to harden into a rule.” 6. The proper context in which Nourse LJ’s statement in Elgindata, should now be viewed, and the effect of the changes consequent upon civil justice reform, is demonstrated by the following passages from the decision of Lord Woolf MR in AEI Ltd v Photographic Performance Ltd [1999] 1 WLR 1507: “I draw attention to the new Rules because, while they make clear that the general rule remains, that the successful party will normally be entitled to costs, they at the same time indicate the wide range of considerations which will result in the court making different orders as to costs. From 26 April 1999 the ‘follow the event principle’ will still play a significant role, but it will be a starting point from which a court can readily depart. This is also the position prior to the new Rules coming into force. The most significant change of emphasis of the new Rules is to require courts to be more ready to make separate orders which reflect the outcome of different issues. In doing this the new Rules are reflecting a change of practice which has already started. It is now clear that too robust an application of the ‘follow the event principle’ encourages litigants to increase the costs of litigation, since it discourages litigants from being selective as to the points they take. If you recover all your costs as long as you win, you are encouraged to leave no stone unturned in your efforts to do so.” (1522H-1523B) The ‘well -established practice’ on which Nourse LJ based his third principle is, as I have already indicated, less generally followed than has been in the past and it is no longer necessary for a party to have acted unreasonably or improperly to be deprived of his costs of a particular issue on which it has failed.” (1523H) 7.

Mr Leung submitted that the conduct of the defendants in conducting this proceeding warranted awarding costs on indemnity basis against them. He drew my attention to the following events: (1) The defendant had opposed to conducting ponding test and a summons had to be taken out for an order that such test be carried out. It was unreasonable for the defendants to refuse the test in the first place. Mr Leung contended that the only reason for the defendants to refuse a ponding test was that they tried to avoid liability by improper means. (2) During the post ponding-test inspections, after being told that the test result was positive, the defendants’ expert on the issue of water leakage tried to avoid joint inspection with the plaintiff’s expert. As a result, various matters were put in dispute including whether fluorescent material existed at the seepage areas; whether the fluorescent material discovered by the plaintiff’s expert belonged to the material used in the test; and dispute on the whereabouts were the photographs produced by the plaintiff’s expert taken. More time and costs had been incurred for the plaintiff to prove its case. Such time and costs could be avoided if the defendants’ had not acted unreasonably. (3) The defendants had only called two witnesses and both of them keep avoiding answering questions posed to them during cross-examination. That had unreasonably lengthened the trial and escalated the costs. Mr Leung criticized the defendants’ witnesses in giving untrue evidence. 143. Mr Ko submitted that it was not an appropriate case to award indemnity costs against the defendants. 144.
