The appellant, a subsidiary of the Grande Group of companies, is the Manager appointed under the DMC (“the Manager”).  No owners incorporation has been formed and the rights and obligations of the owners and the Manager are defined and governed by the DMC and a Supplemental Deed of Mutual Covenant.  5. In April 1997, members of the Grande Group owned various units in the building and together they held 302 out of the 622 undivided shares therein. The respondent (“Sun Wah”) was the owner of a number of units representing another 197 shares.  The remaining shares were held by other smaller owners.  6. On 28 April 1997, an owners meeting was held pursuant to a notice given by the Manager.  However, Sun Wah did not attend.  At the meeting, it was decided that certain renovation works (“the 1997/1998 works”) were to be carried out in the building and it was also unanimously resolved by those who were present that all the owners had to contribute $2,500,000 for the 1997 works and $2,000,000 for the 1998 works according to their respective shares in the building (“the 1997 resolution”).  7. After the renovation works had been completed, Sun Wah was the only owner which did not pay its share of the contributions pursuant to this resolution.  Legal proceedings were instituted against Sun Wah for the recovery of such contribution, but they were subsequently discontinued for reasons which are not material to this appeal.  8. Between 1999 and 2001, the Manager proceeded with further renovation and repair works (“the 1999/2000 works and the 2001 works”) without first obtaining the approval of the owners at an owners meeting. After the works had been completed, a deficit appeared in the accounts of the building.  9. By August 2001, the Grande Group became the owner of 363 shares in the building and thus its majority owner.  An owners meeting was convened by the Manager and subsequently held on 26 September 2001.

In upholding the judge’s conclusion that the 2001 resolutions could not impose liability on Sun Wah, the majority of the Court of Appeal held that these resolutions could not be passed for two main reasons: (1) they only required the owners to make contributions for the costs of renovation works which were carried out between 1997 and 2001 without prior authorization, but did not sanction the unauthorized works. Since there was no power under the DMC to levy contributions for the costs of unauthorized works, these resolutions fell outside the purpose and purview of the DMC; and (2) even if the 2001 resolutions were to be read or framed as giving sanction for carrying out the unauthorized renovation works, such resolutions had violated Sun Wah’s rights in that it had lost the opportunity, before the works were carried out, to persuade other owners not to approve such works or to reduce the amount of works involved. The Manager having previously failed to pass a proper resolution could not be put in a better position after the Grande Group had acquired a majority interest in the building and be allowed to obtain a retroactive sanction of what it could not obtain earlier. 17.

Ratification is usually used in the context of an agent purporting to act on behalf of his principal to create a contractual relationship between his principal and a third party without his principal’s authority. The existence of the principal’s ratification of what the agent has done is necessary in order to fix liability either on the principal or the third party. This is not the case here. We are dealing with the relationship between the agent (the Manager) and the principal (the owners). What was sought to be done at the owners meetings was to approve or sanction what the Manager had previously done without the owners’ authority for the purpose of obtaining contributions from them.

Resolution (3) of the 2001 resolutions which purported to charge interest in excess of that allowed under clause 16 of the DMC is such an example.

Such a resolution cannot be regarded as contradicting or opposed to or inconsistent with any provision in the DMC. 34.

Numerous matters, whether trivial or important, may surface from time to time and on very short notice.  They need to be attended to.  Things need to be done very quickly.  However, there are procedural requirements for convening an owners meeting where approval can be obtained before action can be taken. That is why the Manager is given wide powers by the DMC.  But however detailed and comprehensive the DMC  may be, it cannot cover all exigencies.  There must be occasions when it is necessary to sanction what has been done before the owners can meet, discuss and approve it. Subsequent sanction or approval is also necessary to correct mistakes, cure defects or remedy oversight.  Resolutions for such purposes are very often retrospective in effect.

All the owners paid the new fee.  A year later, it was discovered that the 1997 resolution was invalid since it was not set out in the notice of meeting.  Another meeting was then convened in November 1998 for the purpose of confirming the increase in fees resolved in April 1997 and a resolution was passed to that effect.  In a challenge to both resolutions, it was accepted that the 1997 resolution was invalid.  The Lands Tribunal held that the 1998 resolution had retrospective effect and was thus also invalid since the Ordinance (which contains provisions in its Third Schedule that are similar to clause 10 (iii)) did not empower the passing of resolutions with retrospective effect.  This was upheld by the Court of Appeal which said that it agreed with the reasons given by the Lands Tribunal.  The reasons given by the judge in the Lands Tribunal which were accepted by the Court of Appeal included: that a retrospective resolution may cause the owners to lose the rights which they had already obtained; that it may change a legal action into an illegal action; that it may bring about unstable factors; and that it may affect owners who had transferred their property rights to new owners.", "content_summary": "案例涉及管理費增加決議的有效性，追溯性決議可能導致業主失去已獲權利、造成法律行動轉為非法，並帶來不穩定因素，影響業權轉讓後的業主。", "issue_summary": "追溯性管理費增加決議是否有效。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

For the reasons given by Reyes J, I respectfully agree that there is no good ground for holding that a resolution is invalid simply because it takes retrospective effect. I see no reason why resolutions with retrospective effect should be any different from those with prospective effect unless by their retrospectivity, they are against the law or contrary to the provisions of the DMC or so unfair as to amount to minority oppression.  Clause 10 of the DMC expressly provides that majority resolutions are a means through which owners make decisions concerning the management of the building.  All resolutions, whether prospective or retrospective, are bound to affect the existing rights of the owners in one way or another, some adversely and others beneficially.  There is no basis for saying that retrospective resolutions are invalid because they affect the owners’ rights or “bring about unstable factors”.   As to the situation after a transfer of ownership, I also do not see any difficulty. Former owners are not bound by resolutions passed after they have ceased to be owners of the building (see the sections 39, 40 and 41 of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance, Cap 219 and clause 18 of the DMC).  New owners can always make provision for indemnity or compensation against former owners for any liability which former owners would have been responsible for had they continued to be owners of the building.  In any event, there is nothing unfair in new owners sharing with other co-owners of the building any burden for prior works which runs with the land if they are also entitled to any benefit which may arise from the works carried out in the building.  It must be borne in mind that decisions have to be made from time to time for the better and more efficient management of the building and that all owners have accepted this mode of management by agreeing to be bound by the DMC.  In my view, insofar as the Court of Appeal in So Chun Man Paul had held that in law, no retrospective resolution can be valid, this was erroneous and should not be followed.", "content_summary": "法官認為追溯性決議並非無效，除非違反法律、DMC條款或構成少數壓迫。DMC條款10允許多數決，決議必然影響業主權利。業權轉讓後，前業主不受新決議約束，新業主可尋求補償，並分擔大廈管理相關負擔。", "issue_summary": "追溯性決議的有效性及DMC解釋。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

In the present case, Rogers VP took the view that since there was no power under the DMC to levy contributions for the costs of unauthorized works, the 2001 resolutions were outside the purview of the DMC.  Le Pichon JA agreed with him and added that these resolutions were for this reason also contrary to the DMC.   In my view, once it is accepted, for the reasons discussed above, that the 2001 resolutions had validly sanctioned the unauthorized works, this objection falls away.  The renovation works in question are no longer unauthorized and resolutions requiring contributions among the owners must take effect.  As a matter of fact, under clause (1) (q) of the Second Schedule in the DMC, all owners are obliged to pay for all charges which the owners may resolve by a resolution as necessary or requisite for the proper management, operation and maintenance of the building or for the improvement or maintenance of the services, amenities or facilities thereof.   The majority of the Court of Appeal also held that sanctioning the unauthorized renovation works after the event was not permissible since Sun Wah would have been deprived of an opportunity to address the meeting with a view to persuade the owners to vote against the proposed resolutions.  This is all the more so when there had been a change in the shareholding in the building resulting in the Grande Group now having a majority.  With respect, I do not think this objection can be sustained.   The owners meeting on 26 September 2001 was held for the express purpose of passing the 2001 resolutions.  Proper notice of the meeting was given to all owners who were well aware of the agenda and the purpose of the meeting in advance.  Discussions were held (in fact arguments were made) at the meeting.  There is nothing to show that any owner was not permitted to challenge the renovation works or any part thereof or to persuade other owners not to approve them or to reduce the amount incurred.  I do not see how it can be said that Sun Wah or indeed any owner had lost the opportunity to raise objections if he or it had so wished.  From the minutes, they did raise objections.  On the contrary, while some owners did not attend the 1997 meeting (probably because of the defective agenda), all the owners were present at the 2001 meeting to hear any dissenting voice.", "content_summary": "討論2001年決議是否在DMC範圍內。法官認為一旦未經授權工程被追認，決議有效，業主有義務支付費用。上訴法院認為追認剝奪業主反對機會，但法官反駁稱會議通知充分，業主有機會表達意見。", "issue_summary": "2001年決議對未經授權工程的追認是否有效及會議程序是否公平。", "category": "court_case", "section_type": "reasoning", "embedding_model": null}

There is no provision in the DMC which prohibits the passing of a resolution authorizing works already executed after a change in the shareholding of the building.  So long as it is not contrary to the DMC, there is nothing to prevent the owners from passing such a resolution. The only possible complaint is that the Grande Group could at the 2001 meeting take advantage of their majority shareholding to out-vote Sun Wah and the minority co-owners when they could not have done so at the 1997 meeting.  But I cannot see any objection in abiding by the majority rule unless this is against the law or any provision of the DMC or unless this amounts to minority oppression.
