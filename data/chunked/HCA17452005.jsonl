The defendant contends that the words at the end of clause F-1 should be grouped into two phrases, namely “upon a majority resolution of the owners” and “being passed in accordance with section H hereof.” Mr Pang, counsel for the defendant, argues that it was not unusual for different resolutions to have different requirements for validity. He cites, as an example, paragraph 7 of the Seventh Schedule of the Building Management Ordinance which requires the members or owners of an incorporated owners who own not less than 50 per cent of the shares to vote for a resolution to terminate the service of a manager. However, paragraph 5 of the Third Schedule of the Ordinance only requires a 20 per cent quorum for the dissolution of a management committee and a 10 per cent quorum for other matters. He therefore submits that clause F-1 requires the resolution to be passed by the owners who own not less than 50 per cent of the shares of the commercial portion. 12. Regarding the second phrase, he says that save the definition of the majority vote, all the provisions in section H should apply to clause F-1. These provisions deal with the matters concerning the calling of the meeting, the entitlement to the number of votes, the election of chairman, the casting vote, and so on. Mr Pang further submits that since a resolution under clause F-1 should be made by the owners who own not less than 50 per cent of the shares of the commercial portion, the quorum for such a meeting should therefore not be as small as the owners of 10 per cent of the shares of that portion. He submits that the quorum should be the owners who own at least 50 per cent of the shares of that portion.

It was an easy task. 14.
