However, there is also a well established exception that the burden is shifted to the defending party if the assertion constitutes in effect a negative averment and the balance of convenience lies on the defending party to produce proof of compliance with the law. In this case, the applicant made a negative averment specifically referring to building regulations. I think the balance of convenience lies on the owners incorporated to prove compliance with those regulations. This can be done by the respondent either calling upon the Building Ordinance Office to give evidence or producing expert evidence from qualified engineers in private practice.

The literal interpretation of this paragraph is that it prohibits the erection or construction of any thing on any common part of the building that may be used for the propagation of information or messages. The antenna installation in question here is also a device for the propagation of information and messages.
