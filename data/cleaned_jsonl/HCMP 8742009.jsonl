The defendants’ case is set out in three affirmations made on their behalf by Mr Mok Wei Tak, a director of each of the defendants. As set out in his evidence, it is the defendants’ case, in broad summary, that:- (1) The 6 th and 7 th defendants, together with another related company called Carefree Development Ltd (“Carefree”), held, through their subsidiaries, a 60% interest in a building in Beijing called Central Plaza (“Beijing Central Plaza”). (2) Towards the end of 1997, representatives of the head office and Beijing branch office of Bank of China (“BOC”) visited Beijing Central Plaza and became interested in purchasing the building in order to set up the Beijing branch office of the bank. (3) BOC decided that Kincheng Investments & Developments (China) Ltd (“Kincheng China”) would purchase the shareholding in the subsidiaries of the 6th and 7th defendants in order indirectly to acquire the ownership of Beijing Central Plaza. (4) On 22 February 2000, Kincheng China entered into written agreements with the 6 th defendant, the 7 th defendant and Carefree to purchase the shares of the subsidiaries through which their 60% interest in Beijing Central Plaza was owned. (5) In addition to the stated consideration in the written agreements, it was orally agreed by BOC that Kincheng China would pay the 6 th defendant, the 7 th defendant and Carefree additional consideration in the net amount of HK$186 million as the agent or nominee of its principal, BOC. (6) On 23 March 2001, Kincheng China paid the sum of HK$50 million to the 6th defendant, the 7th defendant and Carefree but has not paid the balance of HK$136 million in breach of the agreement to do so. (7) It was the defendants’ intention to use the proceeds of the sale of their interest in Beijing Central Plaza to repay the defendants’ debts to the plaintiff. As a result of BOC’s and/or Kincheng China’s failure to pay the balance of HK$136 million, the defendants have encountered financial difficulties and have not been able to repay the debts the subject of this action and have suffered other unliquidated loss and damage. (8) Representatives of the plaintiff’s predecessors participated in the course of negotiations between the parties in respect of the non-payment by Kincheng China. The defendants rely on this participation as supporting a contention that the liability of BOC and/or Kincheng China to pay the additional HK$136 million falls within the definition of the businesses and undertakings transferred to and vested in the plaintiff by virtue of the Merger Ordinance. 17. On the basis of the matters referred to above, the defendants contend that the 6 th and 7 th defendants have a valid set-off and counterclaim against the plaintiff for failure to pay the additional HK$136 million. The defendants also seek to set-off their claim, and to counterclaim, for unliquidated damages against their liability to the plaintiff. Since these defences and cross-claims are not suitable for summary dismissal, the defendants contend they should have leave to defend the proceedings and to serve a counterclaim.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 5, "file_name": "HCMP 8742009.jsonl"}

The crux of the defendants’ case is the assumption by the plaintiff of responsibility for the alleged oral agreement by BOC and/or Kincheng China to pay an additional HK$186 million to the 6 th defendant, the 7 th defendant and Carefree by way of consideration for the shares of their subsidiaries. 19. This involves an examination of the terms of the Merger Ordinance to determine what precisely was merged into and transferred to the plaintiff. 20. Under the Merger Ordinance, the merger was limited to the businesses and undertakings of:- (1) BOC HK Branch; (2) the Hong Kong branches of certain Mainland incorporated banks in the Bank of China Group (which included KBC HK Branch); (3) Hua Chiao Commercial Bank Limited (a bank in Hong Kong under the Bank of China Group); and", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 6, "file_name": "HCMP 8742009.jsonl"}

It therefore follows that, in the case of the Bank of China and the Kincheng Banking Corporation only their businesses carried on in or from their branches in Hong Kong were merged into the plaintiff under the Merger Ordinance. 23. Furthermore, by virtue of the definition of the word “existing” in s. 2(1) of the Ordinance, it is only the property and liabilities of the Hong Kong branches of the Mainland incorporated banks existing, outstanding or in force immediately before the appointed time (i.e. 1 October 2001) that were to be transferred to and vest in the plaintiff.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 7, "file_name": "HCMP 8742009.jsonl"}

In support of his submission that the arrangements relating to Beijing Central Plaza were part of the business of KBC HK Branch and/or BOC HK Branch, Mr Coleman SC relied on a number of documents. 27. First, he relied on the minutes of a meeting dated 27 May 1999 (exhibited by Mr Mok as “MWT -2”) at which the purchase of Beijing Central Plaza was discussed. Those minutes identified the “Deputy General Manager of Hong Kong Kincheng Bank” as being present. It is also recorded that the Deputy Branch Manager of the Bank of China Beijing branch inquired whether, since the Beijing branch office was not permitted to set up companies in Hong Kong, “[c]ould Kincheng Bank acquire the shares on its behalf (and hold the shares on trust)”. These were references, he submitted, to the purchase of the building being part of the business being conducted on behalf of BOC by KBC HK Branch. 28. Secondly, he referred to the share acquisition agreements entered into on 22 February 2000 by which Kincheng China agreed to acquire the shares of the subsidiaries of the 6 th defendant, the 7th defendant and Carefree. 29. Thirdly, he referred to a letter from Well Charm Investment Limited, one of the 6 th defendant’s subsidiaries through which it held an interest in Beijing Central Plaza, to Kincheng China dated 5 July 2001 (exhibited by Mr Mok as “MWT -7”), in which there is reference to a balance payment of HK$135,829,937 remaining outstanding as at that date and also reference to a total purchase price for Beijing Central Plaza of RMB720 million. The letter also appends a schedule showing how the total sum of HK$185,829,947 is arrived at and its reduction by the HK$50 million payment in March 2001. 30. Fourthly, Mr Coleman SC referred to an internal memo dated 29 November 2000 entitled “Urgent report on Kincheng Bank’s acquisition of Beijing Central Plaza” (exhibited by Mr Mok as “MWT-10”). This document was copied to “Kincheng Bank, Hong Kong Branch” and was issued by the “Bank of China Hong Kong and Macau Regional Office” (“BOC HK & Macau Regional Office”). Mr Coleman SC submitted that the first sentence of this memo made it clear that (1) it was the KBC HK Branch that was making the acquisition, and (2) the matter was being dealt with by the BOC HK & Macau Regional Office as part of its supervisory role in Hong Kong of BOC and therefore as part of the business of the BOC HK Branch. 31. In connection with the involvement of the BOC HK & Macau Regional Office, Mr Coleman SC also referred to the evidence of Ms Chu Tan Fan, who previously worked in the Business Department of that office, that she had, prior to 1 October 2001, been involved in the preliminary assessment of Kincheng China’s acquisition of Beijing Central Plaza and was responsible for reporting its details and progress to the head office of BOC in Beijing. 32. All of this showed, submitted Mr Coleman SC, that the acquisition of the Beijing Central Plaza was business being carried on by BOC and Kincheng Banking Corporation in or from their branches in Hong Kong and was therefore part of the businesses merged into the plaintiff by virtue of the Merger Ordinance.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 9, "file_name": "HCMP 8742009.jsonl"}

The conclusion I have reached as regards the documents relied upon by Mr Coleman SC is reinforced, in my opinion, by reference to the correspondence in 2008 when the plaintiff was chasing the defendants for repayment of the outstanding banking facilities and to the defendants’ reaction to this. 48. In a letter dated 16 June 2008 from the 7th defendant to the plaintiff, the 7th defendant expressly referred to the indebtedness due and owing by each of the defendants to the plaintiff. Whilst the letter refers to the defendants’ intention to use the funds received from the disposal of Beijing Central Plaza to repay the various loans, it also records that the defendants had, in the meantime, “disposed several properties used as collateral to reduce the amount owing to you” and proposed a number of things including the disposal of the properties defined in this action as the 1st Charged Property and serious consideration to a disposal of the properties defined in this action as the 2nd Charged Property. 49. If the defendants regarded the failure of Kincheng China to pay the additional HK$136 million as a breach of contract for which the plaintiff was responsible and which gave rise to a set-off and counterclaim, it strains credulity that the defendants would have already disposed of other properties to repay their indebtedness in part and would be proposing to dispose of further charged properties for that purpose. 50. The letter of 16 June 2008 concluded with a request to review the interest payable but did not in any way dispute liability for the indebtedness. The letter also included a reference to selling Beijing Central Plaza as one of the proposals for repayment. If the defendants believed there was a liability on the part of the plaintiff in respect of any default by Kincheng China in respect of the acquisition of Beijing Central Plaza, it flies in the face of reality for this not to have been mentioned in this letter. 51.
