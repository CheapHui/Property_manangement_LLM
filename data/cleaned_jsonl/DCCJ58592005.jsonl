There is dispute between CPML and the IO (DCCJ5859/2005) and between PIL and the IO (DCCJ6285/2005) as to  whether CPML’s appointment as manager of the Building under the DMC has been validly terminated pursuant to (a) a resolution (the “Resolution”) passed at an owners ’ meeting on 25 th October 2005 (the “2nd Owners’ Meeting”) and (b) a three-months’ written notice of termination to CPML (the “Termination Notice”).\n\n3.

In DCCJ6285/2005 , PIL on 15 th December 2005 appli ed for interlocutory injunctive relief as stated above pending trial or further order (the “Injunction Summons”). On the return day on 19 th December 2005, HH Judge HC Wong adjourned such summons to 1 st February 2006 for argument (the “Adjourned Hearing”) and gave directions for the filing of affirmation evidence.\n\n5. On 7 th January 2006, the IO  applied in both proceedings ( the “Striking Out Sunmonses ”) for inter alia (a) a declaration pursuant to Order 12 rule 8 of the Rules of the District Court that this cou rt has no jurisdiction over CPML’s and PIL’s claim s and that the ir actions be dismissed with costs (the “Jurisdiction Issue”) or (b) alternatively striking out the indorsement/statement of claims under Order 18 rule 19 of the Rules of the District Court. S uch summonses were adjourned to the hearing on 18 th January 2006 before me for directions.\n\n6. On 9th January 2006, the IO issued a notice of owners ’ meeting to be held on 24 th January 2006 ( ie 4 working days before the Adjourned Hearing, the “New Owners ’ Meeting”) which indicated  an intention to appoint a new manager at the meeting (the “2nd New Notice ”). But the Injunction Summons returnable on 1 st February 2006 seeks amongst other reliefs an interlocutory injunction to restrain the IO from taking steps to appoint a new manager  until trial or further order (the “New Manager Injunction”). On 13th January 2006 PIL applied (the “Interim Summons”) inter alia to restrain the IO until the Adjourned Hearing from (a) terminating CPML ’s appointment as manager of the B uilding, (b) acting on the Resolution or (c) taking steps to appoint any new manager (the “Interim New Manager Injunction”), and to cancel the Resolution. At the hearing before me on 18 th January 2006, Ms Ho, counsel for PIL, confirmed that PIL would not apply under the Interim Summons to cancel the Resolution.\n\n7. At the hearing on 18 th January 2006, Mr Hung, counsel for the IO, confirmed the Termination Notice would only expire at midnight on 1 st February 2006, so the IO would not terminate or expel CPML as manager of the Building prior such deadline. In the circumstances, Ms Ho confirmed PIL would only pursue the Interim New Manager Injunction under the Interim Summons.\n\n8. It is common ground that irrespective of the outcome of the Interim Summons, the Adjour ned Hearing of the Injunction Summons will proceed as scheduled. Whether PIL will pursue the New Manager Injunction will depend on (a) whether the Interim New Manager Injunction will be granted, (b) if so, whether the owners at the New Owners ’ Meeting will resolve to appoint a new manager and (c) if so, whether a new manager will be appointed before the Adjourned Hearing (the “Factors”). Mr Hung expresses confidence that the IO will be able to appoint a new manager on/before 1 st February 2006 if the Interim  New Manager Injunction is refused, but he accepts that it is more of an expectation than a foregone reality.\n\n9. On 18th January 2006, the following matters were adjourned to be heard before me on 23rd January 2006, the day before the New Owners ’ Meeting : (a) the Jurisdiction Issue under the Striking Out Summonses (to be heard before the Interim Summons); (b) the application for the Interim New Manager Injunction under the Interim Summons; (c) the remaining issues under the Striking Out Summonses (for directions only).\n\n10. As issue (b) was urgent, I gave my ruling after hearing ar guments. I granted leave to the IO to challenge jurisdiction out of time in DCCJ5859/2005, but dismissed the IO’s applications in both DCCJ5859/2005 and DCCJ6285/2005 to strike out the claims for w ant of jurisdiction with costs . Consequent to such ruling , at counsel ’s invitation, I made no order in respect of the IO’s applications on the alternative grounds in both Striking Out Summonses. I also granted the Interim New Manager Injunction. I now give my reasons.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 2, "file_name": "DCCJ58592005.jsonl"}

However, I am not with Mr Leong SC in his submissions concerning Section V clause A(2) of the DMC, which provides that the owners “shall determine [the manager’s] appointment by six months’ notice in writing to the Manager”. Mr Leong SC argues that since such provision is not inconsistent with paragraph 7 of the Seventh Schedule, which requires a notice period of “not less than 3 months” to terminate the manager’s appointment, section 34E of the BMO will not cause paragraph 7 of the Seventh Schedule to prevail over Section V clause A(2) of the DMC. Mr Leong SC contends that in the circumstances the IO ought to have given 6 months’ notice to terminate CPML’s appointment as manager, so the Resolution giving 3 months’ notice is in breach of the express provisions of the DMC. 25. According to Kent, Merry and Walters, Building Management in Hong Kong (2002) at p.80, the purpose of Part VIA of the BMO is said to be as follows: “The practical effect of Part VIA is that it limits the developer’s powers to insert unfair terms in the DMC in the future and prevents the developer or manager relying on terms in DMCs executed before 1993, if they are inconsistent with Part VIA.” If Mr Leong SC were right, a provision in the DMC that requires, say, 2 years’ notice for terminating the manager’s appointment will still be valid and binding as being not inconsistent with the Seventh Schedule that requires not less than three-months’ notice. Such interpretation defeats the purpose of section 34E of the BMO and is, in my view, incorrect. Rather, I am of the view that in a contest between paragraph 7 of the Seventh Schedule and the notice requirement in Section V clause A(2) of the DMC, the former shall prevail.

Ong claimed the 7 Incidents had been individually discussed in earlier MC meetings (eg at the 5th and 6th MC meetings held on 16th and 30th June 2005 respectively), which minutes had been posted up for the owners’ information. But Lee said only the alleged 7th Incident was raised during the MC meetings, so the owners would not know of the allegations in the Journal prior to the 2nd Owners’ Meeting.

Ong claimed it was “incapable” or unnecessary to announce the number of undivided shares held by the attendees before casting of the votes.\n\n41. It was announced that the Resolution was passed by a simple majority of 50.6% representing 2,519 undivided shares. There is no dispute that Lee acted as 1 of 3 scrutineers for counting the votes for the 2nd Item and the 3 rd item of the agenda (ie request tender applications from management companies to act as manager of the Building within 3 months of the Resolution, the “3rd Item”).\n\n42. There is also no dispute that in the course of counting the votes, Lee raised a doubt as to whether a ballot form recording the undivided shares referred to “3” or “5” and it was subsequently clarified. Lee said the relevant digit should in fact be “1”. Ong said this happened during the counting of votes for the 3rd Item.\n\n43. Lee expressed doubt about 2 ballot forms respectively representing 600 odd and 800 odd undivided shares, which were equivalent to more than 22 or 28 units in the Building. But Ong said they were not unusual since her own vote represented over 400 undivided shares (including proxies). Heng Ngai alone held 626 undivided shares, so its ballot form (with the proxies it carried) could have represented over 600 or 800 undivided shares.\n\n44. Lee claimed that CPML’s position was much prejudiced because the owners did not know of the MC’s intention to terminate CPML’s appointment as manager ever since the 1 st Owners’ Meeting and those owners who gave proxies might not have supported the Resolution had they been able to hear CPML’s response to the allegations.

Ong claimed that the MC intended to convene another owners ’ meeting to select a new manager since CPML’s appointment would terminate on 1st February 2006 and time was running out . On 1 st December 2005, the IO issued a notice of owners ’ meeting to be held on 20 th December 2005 for appointing a new manager for the Building (the “1st New Notice”).\n53. On 9th December 2005, CPML ’s solicitors made a further request for inspection of the Documents and asked the IO to adjourn the owners’ meeting to be held on 20th December 2005.\n54. On 13 th December 2005, the IO’s solicitors by letter denied CPML’s claim and assertions in DCCJ5859/2005.\n55. Ong claimed the IO was concerned litigation might delay and complicate the selection/appointment of the new manager, so on 13 th December 2005 the IO made a without prejudice offer for inspection of the Documents on 16th December 2005 and it also withheld taking steps in DCCJ5859/2005 that would occasion legal costs in the hope that the inspection might resolve the matter. By this time, it was more than 6 weeks after CPML ’s initial request for inspection and after it had commenced legal proceedings.\n56.

On 17 th December 2005, CPML ’s solicitors wrote to the IO’s solicitors to re-arrange inspection. On the same day, the IO issued an emergency notice to the owners to call off the owners ’ meeting to be held on 20 th December 2005. After further negotiations, the parties on 19 th December 2005 agreed to have the inspection on 21 st December 2005. Consequently, at the hearing before H H Judge H C Wong on 19 th December 2005, the Injunction Summons was adjourned to the Adjourned Hearing.

Under these principles, the court first has to be satisfied there are serious questions to be tried and then move on to consider the balance of convenience. Mr Hung by his written submissions for the hearing on 18th January 2006 submits that since the injunctive reliefs sought in the Interim Summons will finally dispose of the action in favour of whichever party is successful in the application so that there will be nothing left on which it is in the unsuccessful party’s interest to proceed to trial, the court is therefore entitled to consider the degree of likelihood of PIL succeeding at the trial (Hong Kong Civil Procedure 2006 Vol.1 para.29/1/18 at p.516 and Lansing Linde Ltd v Kerr [1991] 1 WLR 251, 258). Mr Hung says that as a result of the second inspection on 9th January 2006, the court is in a position to consider PIL’s degree of likelihood in succeeding at the trial. However, PIL has since confirmed it will only apply for the Interim New Manager Injunction under the Interim Summons and it proposes to leave its application for other interlocutory injunctive relief to the Adjourned Hearing. So even if PIL is successful in seeking the Interim New Manager Injunction, the matter becomes at large again at the Adjourned Hearing and PIL will continue to apply for the New Manager Injunction as well as other interlocutory injunctive relief. If, on the other hand, PIL is unsuccessful in seeking the Interim New Manager Injunction, whether there will be an application for the New Manager Injunction will depend on the Factors referred to above. In light of such developments, Mr Hung accepts at the hearing on 23rd January 2006 that the proper approach for considering whether to grant the Interim New Manager Injunction is on the usual American Cynamid principles, ie whether there are serious questions to be tried. In my view, that must be correct since it cannot be said that the outcome of the application for the Interim New Manager Injunction will in practice determine the action. The Adjourned Hearing will proceed as scheduled irrespective of such outcome. Further, the Interim New Manager Injunction (if granted) expires after the Adjourned Hearing and it does not resolve the fundamental validity/legality or otherwise of the Resolution.

Mr Leong SC submits that it is telling that the IO pushed ahead with the New Owners’ Meeting despite (a) the cancellation of the new owners’ meeting for the same purpose originally intended to be held on 20 th December 2005, (b) the understanding by the parties at the hearing on 19 th December 2005 (as embodied in the court order) that PIL’s application for the New Manager Injunction and other interlocutory injunctive relief would be argued at the Adjourned Hearing and (c) the filing of further affirmation evidence by both parties for such purpose thereafter. 93. Given counsel’s common stance that the question of whether any party’s conduct is tainted by ulterior motives is better left to be canvassed at the Adjourned Hearing, I propose to consider only counsel’s submissions and the factual matters raised in the affirmation evidence on the subject only insofar as they are relevant to the issues before me. But, generally speaking, I cannot say the above assertions of ulterior purpose are of substantial assistance at this stage. In my view, given the interim nature of the Interim New Manager Injunction and the fact that its life will not exceed the conclusion of the Adjourned Hearing, the true area of contest between the parties is on the question of the balance of convenience or the balance of the risk of doing an injustice.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 48, "file_name": "DCCJ58592005.jsonl"}

The IO knew all along that the Termination Notice expires on 1st February 2006. This is not the first attempt by the IO to convene an owners’ meeting to deal with the issue of appointing a new manager. The proposed owners’ meeting to be held on 20th December 2005 was cancelled as a result of the scheduled first inspection of the Documents. It was against such background that on 19th December 2005 the IO through Mr Hung asks HH Judge H C Wong to adjourn the Injunction Summons for argument and for directions for the filing of affirmation evidence. Ever since 19th December 2005, the IO knew that the Injunction Summons was adjourned to the Adjourned Hearing on 1st February 2006 for argument.\n100. Although it has been said that the IO has chosen to adopt a pragmatic approach to wait and see the results of the inspection, the IO’s stance at the hearing on 19th December 2005 plainly shows that it is alive to the possibility that the inspection may not be fruitful and the matter may have to be resolved by legal contest over the Injunction Summons at the Adjourned Hearing. Yet the IO issued the 2nd New Notice on the very day of the second inspection of the Documents. There is no suggestion that the IO or its legal advisors have considered or explored the possibility of bringing forward the Injunction Summons or even just the application for the New Manager Injunction to have the matter resolved before 1st February 2006.

It was said in that case that feelings ran high at the owners’ meeting that passed the resolution to terminate the manager and “there was manifest hostility exhibited by members of the incorporated owners, other than [the members of the management committee], to representatives of the [manager]”. I agree with Mr Leong SC there is no sufficient evidence that CPML has fallen out with the majority of the owners. There is no dispute that Ong circulated the Journal at the 2nd Owners’ Meeting, but there does not appear to be clear evidence that the owners/attendees exhibited hostility against CPML at the meeting. The Minutes noted that after Ms Leung was granted an opportunity to explain the 7 Incidents at the meeting, the attendees took the view that, in order not to delay the progress of the meeting, the meeting was not the appropriate occasion to discuss the 7 Incidents and they requested the IO to follow up. The Minutes did not reflect that the owners/attendees came to any firm view on the 7 Incidents at the 2nd Owners’ Meeting, let alone expressions of hostility against CPML. There is also no evidence before me of what follow up has been undertaken by the IO since the 2nd Owners’ Meeting in respect of the 7 Incidents and what the owners’ reaction was to any such follow up by the IO. Whilst Ong claimed all 7 Incidents being complaints against CPML’s performance have been discussed at earlier MC meetings, the minutes of the 8 MC meetings do not reflect all of the 7 Incidents. Indeed, Lee claimed they at best only reflect the 7th Incident. It is also PIL’s/CPML’s case that the 7 Incidents can be readily explained and there is no dispute that Ms Leung did give explanations at the 2nd Owners’ Meeting. Given that the parties have agreed that the question of whether there are serious questions to be tried should not to be canvassed at the hearing before me, it is an open question at this stage as to whether the 7 Incidents support an arguable case for terminating CPML’s appointment as manager for cause. But 2 matters are evident. First, most of the 7 Incidents, whether rightly or wrongly, have already been resolved. For example, the insurance company has already been changed (1st Incident), the accounts have been rectified (2nd and 4th Incidents), the 2006 budget has been passed with management fees chargeable at HK$0.07/ft (6th Incident) and the one-month extension of the cleaning services contract has expired (7th Incident). As regards Mr Hung’s complaint that the 5th Incident is still outstanding, that relates to information on employees’ salaries and benefits and not the day-to-day management of the Building. Secondly, the time window in question under the First Scenario is a very narrow one, ie about a fortnight or so for convening a new owners’ meeting to appoint a new manager. As regards Mr Hung’s complaint that the litigation between PIL/ CPML and the IO has been conducted in a hostile manner, whilst it is true the parties are vigorously insistent on their perceived rights, there is little to suggest that such attitude has carried over to CPML’s handling of the day-to-day management of the Building. There is no evidence before me of any complaint against the IO’s performance in the day-to-day management of the Building since the Resolution was passed and/or the Termination Notice was issued. As regards Mr Hung’s suggestion of mala fide motives on CPML’s part in refusing to release funds for legal expenses, I bear in mind counsel’s common understanding at the hearing before me not to delve into the issue of ulterior motives. In any event, this issue does not touch on the day-to-day management of the Building and if there is a genuine basis to the IO’s complaint, there are of course", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 69, "file_name": "DCCJ58592005.jsonl"}

Section 18(1)(c) of the BMO provides that (irrespective of whether there is or is not any manager) the incorporated owners shall do all things reasonably necessary for the enforcement of the obligations contained in the DMC (if any) for the control, management and administration of the building and it may exercise the powers in section 18(2) in respect of the management of the building. After all, the manager carries out the duties and powers of the incorporated owners on their behalf and the manager’s departure cannot and will not diminish the incorporated owners’ statutory duties and powers. Further, the MC can on the IO’s behalf exercise the powers and duties of the IO under section 29 of the BMO. I note the IO claims it relies on the assistance of volunteers, but it is a far cry from having anarchy over the intervening period until a new owners’ meeting can be held.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 73, "file_name": "DCCJ58592005.jsonl"}

I do not propose to repeat them again. I am not persuaded by Mr Hung’s argument that PIL should not complain about having a new manager in the place and stead of CPML because it is bound by the Resolution. After all, the validity or legality of the Resolution is the very subject of dispute in these proceedings. If at the end of the day the validity or legality of the Resolution cannot be supported, then the so-called majority decision by the owners allegedly reflected in the Resolution is void or voidable. I cannot see how a future owners’ meeting can help rectify any voidable or void resolution. I further do not see how mitigation of CPML’s loss comes into play if at the end of the day the Resolution is avoided for being invalid or illegal.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 74, "file_name": "DCCJ58592005.jsonl"}

Mr Leong SC says that such remark is not only uncalled for but is also unsupported by evidence. He urges me to ignore the same. Mr Leong SC submits that even if at the end of the day PIL is found to have been erroneous in pursuing its claim in the present proceedings, it does not follow that the IO is entitled to take steps to appoint a new manager pending the resolution of the Injunction Summons at the Adjourned Hearing.
