I fully accept, as was submitted by Mr Edward Chan, SC (with the support of a citation from So Chun Man Paul & others v. The Incorporated Owners of Chee On Building (unreported), CACV No. 302 of 1999) that the aim of the Ordinance is to protect the interest of owners of a building and to guard the owners against any abuse of office by the management committee.  But, even accepting this, I understand that, unless displaced by clear words, the rule of evidence is that although minutes of meetings are sufficient (and usually the best) evidence of the proceedings to which they relate, they are not exclusive evidence of such proceedings.  The provisions of clause 10 are, no doubt, mandatory.  They do require the secretary to keep the appropriate minutes.  They do require that the minutes are to be certified by the person presiding over the meeting and they do require that the minutes so certified are to be displayed by the secretary in a prominent place in the building.  But it does not follow that a resolution which can be proved aliunde (as the Latin scholars say) to have been duly passed must be ignored by the court simply because the person presiding over the meeting, or the secretary, may have failed in one or other of these duties.\n\nIn the present case, there really is no room for any doubt but the resolutions which appear to have been passed by the meeting of the management committee and which bear the chop of the plaintiff were resolutions duly passed.  That being so, there can be no doubt that these proceedings were duly authorised.  It is unnecessary to examine the question whether the meeting of 23 July 1998 (the meeting of the owners to which I have referred) was or was not sufficient to authorise these proceedings.  As Mr Edward Chan, SC very properly accepts, if the court accepts that there is sufficient evidence of the passing of those resolutions by the management committee, no point on the meeting of the owners on 23 July 1998 will be of any assistance to the 1st defendant.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 7, "file_name": "CACV 1222000.jsonl"}
