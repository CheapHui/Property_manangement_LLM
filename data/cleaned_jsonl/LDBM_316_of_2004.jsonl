The Respondent is the Incorporated Owners of Yue Shing Commercial Building, 15 -19 Queen Victoria Street, Central, Hong Kong ( “the Building”).  The 1 st Applicant is the present registered ow ner of Units A, B & C of 20th Floor of the Building ( “the Units”).  The 2 nd and 3rd Applicants were previously the joint registered owners of the Units and they transferred the Units to the 1st Applicant on 25 July 2003.\n\n2. On 17 May 2004, the Respondent filed a claim in the Small Claims Tribunal under Case No. SCTC036102/04, whereby the Respondent claimed against the 1st Applicant for the following items: -\n\nItem 1: $13,118.00 being the management fee payable by the owner of the Units for the period from November 2003 to May 2004;\n\nItem 2: $10,500.00 being the contribution payable by the owner of the Units in respect of the Building’s lift works; and\n\nItem 3: $210.00 being the late charge.\n\n3. The 1st Applicant admitted Item 1 and Item 2 of the claim, but raised a counterclaim for the refund of $126,000.00 being the contribution paid by the previous owners of the Units, i.e. the 2 nd and 3rd Applicants, to the Respondent on 9 October 2002 in respect of the Building ’s fire safety improvement works.  As the co unterclaim was beyond the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Tribunal, the Adjudicator in the Small Claims Tribunal transferred the counterclaim to the Lands Tribunal on 21 September 2004.  The Adjudicator entered judgment in favour of the Respondent for Ite m 1  and Item 2 of the claim, but stayed the enforcement of the claim pending the final disposition of the counterclaim.  The Adjudicator also dismissed Item 3 of the claim.  Thus, the present proceedings in the Lands Tribunal concern only the counterclaim.\n\n4. By an order of H.H. Judge Chan on 28 October 2004, the titles of the parties were reversed, i.e. the Respondent (who was the claimant in the Small Claims Tribunal action) became the respondent in the present proceedings, and the 1st Applicant (who was  the defendant in the Small Claims Tribunal action) became the applicant in the present proceedings.  On 4 January 2005, H.H. Judge Chan gave leave to join the 2 nd and 3 rd Applicants as applicants in the present proceedings.  In other words, the countercla im in the Small Claims Tribunal has become the claim of the 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd Applicants against the Respondent in the present proceedings.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 1, "file_name": "LDBM_316_of_2004.jsonl"}

On 25 July 2000, the Fire Services Department and the Buildings Department issued 2 Fire Safety  Improvement Directions ( collectively “the Fire Safety Directions ”) to the Respondent requiring the Respondent to carry out various fire safety improvement works for the Building.\n\n6. At an owners ’ meeting held on 28 August 2001, the Respondent resolved that a Task-force Committee ( “the Fire Safety Committee ”) be formed to co -ordinate and handle the fire safety improvement works, and to engage a consultant company to take steps to ensure compliance of the Fire Safety Directions.  The Respondent further res olved that the fire safety improvement works would be re-tendered.  In fact, the former manager of the Building, Land Asia Management Limited (“Land Asia”), had previously chosen one “Suen Tat Metal Machine Factory Limited ” to be the contractor for the fir e safety improvement works.\n\n7. On 19 January 2002, the Fire Safety Committee resolved to engage Archidesign & Associates Limited ( “Archidesign”) as the consultant and the authorized person in respect of the fire safety improvement works.\n\n8. On 21 January 2002, the Fire Safety Committee opened 3 tenders for the fire safety improvement works.  Together with the 5 tenders obtained by Land Asia earlier, the Fire Safety Committee resolved to pass the 8 tenders for the fire safety improvement works to Archidesign for analysis.\n\n9. In February 2002, Archidesign prepared a Tender Analysis Report in respect of the 8 tenders (“the Report”).  In paragraph 2.3 of the Report, under the heading “ARITHMETICAL CHECK ”, Archidesign stated that Global Engineering (HK) ( “Global”) was the only tenderer that complied with all the requirements and in order.  However, in paragraph 4.2 of the Report, under the heading, “CONCLUSION”, Archidesign suggested that an interview be conducted with the two qualified tenderers, i.e. Global a nd Alliance Building Service Engineering Ltd. (“Alliance”).\n\n10. On 28 February 2002, the Management Committee of the Re spondent discussed the Report and accepted the suggestion that the tenderers would be separately interviewed for further details and particulars of the tenders.\n\n11. At an owners ’ meeting on 7 March 2002, it was resolved that a contractor who could meet the minimum requirements of the Fire Services Department would be appointed to follow up the fire safety improvement works.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 2, "file_name": "LDBM_316_of_2004.jsonl"}

On 12 Aug ust 2002, Mr. Yeung Wai Man, the Chairman of the Respondent, issued a notice to convene an owners ’ meeting on 3 September 2002.  It was stated in the notice that the following matters were to be discussed: -\n\n“（一）通過接納「消防工程專責小組及則師報告建議」 。\n（二）通過接納進行本廈消防工程之承辦商事宜。\n（三）通過工程總額及業戶攤分款項事宜。\n（四）其他事項。”\n\n13.

I agree with the Respondent that the word “passing” in Chinese must refer to “passing resolution” in the context of the notice.\n\n15. At a meeting of the Management Committee of the Respondent held on 23 August 2002, Archidesign reported that the “old tenders” would continue to be used, and that there were 2 qualified finalists, i.e. Global and Alliance.  The Respondent resolved that th e validity of the tenders would be extended and the Fire Safety Committee would interview the 2 finalists on 28 August 2002.  The Fire Safety Committee was to report to the Respondent on its recommendation before 3 September 2002.\n\n16. On 27 August 2002 (i .e. 7 days before the owners ’ Meeting on 3 September 2002), Global withdrew its tender.\n\n17.

Subsequently, various variation works and Additional Builder’s Works were awarded to Alliance totalling $382,429.50. The Applicants ’ claim is that section 20A of the Building Management Ordinance, Cap. 344 ( “the BMO”), has been violated as there was no valid tender to award the contract for the fire safety improvement works to Alliance. Since the Respondent had no power to enter into the contract with Alliance, the Respondent could not ask for contributions from the owner s of the Building. The 2 nd and 3rd Applicants are therefore entitled to have the refund of $126,000.00 from the Respondent. On 25 July 2003, together with the assignment of the Units, the 2 nd and 3rd Applicants transferred the right to claim for the refu nd to the 1 st Applicant. Thus, the 1 st Applicant also alleges that it has the right to claim for the refund. The Applicants are asking for the refund of $126,000.00 to either the 1 st Applicant or the 2 nd and 3rd Applicants as this Tribunal thinks fit. At the trial, the Applicants added another claim for a declaration that the resolutions passed at the owners ’ meeting on 3 September 2002 in connection with the acceptance of the recommendations of the Fire Safety Committee and the Architect ’s report, a nd the contributions to be rendered by the owners be void and of no effect. The grounds for applying this relief are that:- “(a) the notice convening the 3 September 2002 meeting is defective as it failed to render sufficient information on (i) the resolution to be passed therein; (ii) the proposals to be proposed by those managing the Respondent in relation to such resolutions; (iii) so as to enable the owners to form an informed view on whether to attend the meeting and vote for on against any resolution to be tabled therein (b) those managing the Respondent have failed to provide full and frank disclosure of relevant information from the date of dispatch of such notice to the date of such meeting.”", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 4, "file_name": "LDBM_316_of_2004.jsonl"}

Paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 3 of the BMO states that: - “Every notice ……….. shall specify: - …………… (b) every resolution to be proposed or other matter to be discussed at the meeting.” Paragraph 3(7) of Schedule 3 of the BMO states that: - “No resolution passed at any meeting of the corporation shall have effect unless the same was set forth in the notice ………or is ancillary or incidental to a resolution or other matter so set forth.” Relying on the aforesaid provisions, Mr. Kuan submitted that the notice did not contain any resolution that was proposed by those managing the Respondent. The content of the notice was coached in very vague terms to the effect that something about the fire safety improvement works were to be decided, and strictly speaking, there was no mention of any proposal intended by those managing the Respondent on the matters to be dealt with at the 3 September 2002 meeting. I do not agree with Mr. Kuan ’s submission. As I have already said, the word “passing” in Chinese must refer to “passing resolution” in the context of the notice. There can be no other meaning. It should be clear to any owner that there would be resolutions to be passed in relation to the matters stated in paragraphs (1) to (3) of the notice. Even though the word “resolution” in Chinese was not expressly used in the agenda, I do not find that paragraph 2(2)(b) of Schedule of the BMO has been breached. In fact, the resolutions passed at the meeting on 3 September 2002 were all related to the matters stated in the notice.

Thus, there was nothing in the notice enabling any owner to decide on whether to attend the meeting to vote for or against any proposal or whether to leave the matter to be determined by the majority attending and voting at the meeting.

Mr. Kuan relied on the Code of Practice on Procurement of Supplies, Goods and Services issued by the Home Affairs Department in July 1997 in pursuance of Section 44 of the BMO, which states that: “Any supplies, goods or services the value of which exceeds or is likely to exceed: (a) the sum of $100,000.00 ……… shall be procured by invitation to tender.” “….. the management committee shall prepare a proposal setting out the types of supplies of goods or service required, the respective estimated costs and the period open for tender. A copy of the tender proposal shall be displayed at a prominent place of the building.” “the minimum number of tenders to be sought shall be as follows:- ………. (b) 5 in the case of tenders for supplies, goods or service exceeding a value of $100,000.00.” 34. Also, section 20A of the BMO stipulates that: “(1) the Procurement of all supplies, goods or services required by corporation …. Shal l comply with such standards and guidelines as may be specified in a Code of Practice…… (2) Any supplies …... the value of which exceeds or is likely to exceed …… the sum of $100,000 …… shall be procured by invitation to tender. (3) The procurement by invitation to tender …… and the tender procedure in respect thereof shall comply with such standards and guidelines as may be specified in a Code of Practice …..” 35. Mr. Kuan submitted that “tender” in this context means “an offer or bid put forward for acceptance” and that the Code of Practice has clearly statutory force. Despite the resolution of the Management Committee on 23 August 2002, which in effect stated that there was no need for any invitation for tender in respect of the Additional Builders ’ Work, it does not alter the fact that there was no provision governing the provision of any additional works or variation works in either the Form of Tender or the Conditions of Tender. The Additional Builder ’s Work cannot be said as having any relation with the invitation to tender which had held before. Given the sum involved in the Additional Builder ’s Work was over HK$10,000.00, it must be procured by invitation to tender and that at least 5 tenders in that regard must be sought. However, nothing to that effect has been carried out by the Respondent. Thus, Mr. Kuan contended that the procurement of the Additional Builder ’s Works is in breach of section 20A of the BMO and the Code of Practice, and therefore the portion of contribution for financing such works must either be wholly void or at least voidable. 36. I do not agree with Mr. Kuan on this issue either. There are many authorities as cited by Mr. Choi, for the Respondent, that the Code of Practice is only directory in nature.
