It is common ground that the respondent was one of the fourteen duly appointed members of the management committee for 1994 of the Incorporated Owners of Beverley Heights.

According to the Grounds of Opposition filed by the respondent, during the meeting, management fees and secretarial charges were discussed on the item of \"Any Other Business\" and a resolution was then passed appointing Arch Link to provide secretarial services to the applicant including \"settling management fees invoices, serving notices of meetings of Committee members, drafting letters, employee appointment contracts, house rules, all typing works (sic), minutes of meetings, and circulars from time to time\" at the rate of $5,000 per month. The respondent contends that Arch Link did provide services pursuant to the resolution and was paid for four months. It is the respondent's position that the payments were authorized pursuant to section 18(2)(c) of the Building Management Ordinance, Cap. 344 (\"the Ordinance\").   The applicant contends that (1) there was no resolution at the meeting authorizing the payments, that (2) even if there was such resolution, the resolution was invalid because no proper notice was given for the resolution, that (3) even if the resolution is valid, the respondent being the alter ego of Arch Link could not be properly remunerated under section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance, that (4) the remuneration at $5,000 per month to the respondent exceeded the maximum limit permitted by section 18(2)(aa) of the Ordinance and was therefore recoverable, and that (5) certain work done by Arch Link purportedly pursuant to the said resolution was duplicitous, being falling within the duties of the secretary of the management committee or the building manager employed by the applicant and so it was wrong to approve separate payment to Arch Link.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 3, "file_name": "BM_NO.32_of_1995.jsonl"}

I could see that the conflict of evidence will aggravate the relationship of the parties and possibly split the residents of the building estate into factions when one or other witnesses would eventually be held to have in effect lied in court or not acted in accordance with acceptable moral standards in the management of the affairs of the applicant. Also in consideration of the time needed to hear witnesses in this cases which could have been profitably used for other cases, I suggested to the parties that perhaps the case can be decided on strict legal principles so that any cause lost can be attributed to purely technical grounds; that way, the parties concerned, extending to those in court and outside court, as neighbours and fellow residents within the building estate can repair relations. Consequently, counsel for the parties made submissions on preliminary points of law which may, perhaps, dispose of the case without hearing further evidence.  As I see it, and as counsel in their submission have argued, there are three crucial preliminary points. The first is whether the resolution allegedly passed at the meeting was valid as a matter of procedure. The second is whether the respondent could properly be appointed and remunerated under section 18(2) (c) of the Ordinance.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 4, "file_name": "BM_NO.32_of_1995.jsonl"}

See Young v. Ladies Imperial Club (1920) 2 K.B. 523. Obviously, in this case, there was no disclosure of interest in the notice. Moreover, bearing in mind section 18(2)(aa) of the Ordinance requires approval by the corporation in general meeting for payment to members of the management committee, I should think remuneration under section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance to a member of the management committee should also be approved by the corporation in general meeting with proper notice having been given to all members of the corporation.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 7, "file_name": "BM_NO.32_of_1995.jsonl"}

(Emphasis added) I think one must distinguish (1) the powers and duties of the corporation which are corporate in nature, (2) the powers and duties of the management committee which are collective in nature, and (3) the powers and duties of each member of the management committee which are personal in nature. There must be numerous instances where the performance of duties of a member of the management committee is also the discharge of the duties of the corporation or the management committee. However, there are also instances where the act of a member of the management committee cannot be treated as a corporate act or collective act. For example, the secretary is required by provisions in the Second Schedule to issue notice of meeting of the management committee. One cannot say that the issue of notice is the act of the corporation, because the corporation has no power nor duty to issue notice of meeting of the management committee.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 8, "file_name": "BM_NO.32_of_1995.jsonl"}

Of the 'settling management fees invoices, serving notices of meetings of Committee members, drafting letters, employee appointment contracts, house rules, all typing works, minutes of meetings, and circulars from time to time' done or to be done by Arch Link, I find that settling management fees invoices, serving notices of meetings of management committee, drafting letters and typing work, all purely secretarial or clerical duties, cannot possibly be regarded in law as powers and duties of the corporation. It follows that the contracting out of these duties cannot come under section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance. It is not clear what 'employee appointment contracts, house rules, minutes of meetings, and circulars from time to time' means. Assuming 'employee appointment contracts, house rules, minutes of meetings and circulars from time to time' come under powers and duties of the corporation, they are mixed with, and thus degraded by, purely secretarial or clerical duties that I do not think they should be isolated for the purpose of justifying remuneration under section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 9, "file_name": "BM_NO.32_of_1995.jsonl"}

That paragraph quite clearly sets a maximum limit for allowances receivable by management committee members. It has been canvassed on behalf of the respondent that management committee members should not be barred from receiving more if the work involved is particularly onerous. It is said that it would be unfair to expect committee members to provide service on statutory allowance in all cases irrespective of the workload. I should think 'allowance' in section 18(2)(aa) in contradistinction to 'remunerate' in section 18(2)(c) of the Ordinance very well illustrates the nature of payment to management committee members. Members of a management committee should not expect remuneration fully commensurate with the market value of their work. Their work in the committee is a kind of public service. The Ordinance already tries to be fair by setting different levels of allowances for estates with different number of units. See the Fourth Schedule to the Ordinance. No person can be compelled to serve on a management committee. A person may very well decline to accept office in a management committee if he or she feels that the level of allowance for the office is unsatisfactory.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 10, "file_name": "BM_NO.32_of_1995.jsonl"}
