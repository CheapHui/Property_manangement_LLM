The rights and obligations of the owners and the manager of a multi-storey building are usually defined and governed by a deed of mutual covenant in respect of the building.  This deed is a contract which runs so as to bind all owners and their assignees and the manager.  Some of these rights and obligations are modified by the Building Management Ordinance, Cap 344 (“the Ordinance”). The provisions of the deed and the Ordinance are usually aimed at facilitating the management of the building by reducing conflicts among co-owners on the one hand and preventing abuse by the manager and the majority owner on the other.  It is fair to say that most disputes are resolved by a purposive construction and common sense application of the relevant provisions of the deed and the Ordinance.  3. The present appeal involves the construction of the provisions of the Deed of Mutual Covenant executed on 14 May 1982 (“the DMC”) in respect of an industrial building in Kwun Tong known as the Grande Building and the validity of certain resolutions passed at an owners meeting held pursuant to the DMC requiring the owners to make contributions for the purpose of funding renovation works carried out in the building.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 1, "file_name": "FACV No. 2 of 2006.jsonl"}

The appellant, a subsidiary of the Grande Group of companies, is the Manager appointed under the DMC (“the Manager”).  No owners incorporation has been formed and the rights and obligations of the owners and the Manager are defined and governed by the DMC and a Supplemental Deed of Mutual Covenant.  5. In April 1997, members of the Grande Group owned various units in the building and together they held 302 out of the 622 undivided shares therein. The respondent (“Sun Wah”) was the owner of a number of units representing another 197 shares.  The remaining shares were held by other smaller owners.  6. On 28 April 1997, an owners meeting was held pursuant to a notice given by the Manager.  However, Sun Wah did not attend.  At the meeting, it was decided that certain renovation works (“the 1997/1998 works”) were to be carried out in the building and it was also unanimously resolved by those who were present that all the owners had to contribute $2,500,000 for the 1997 works and $2,000,000 for the 1998 works according to their respective shares in the building (“the 1997 resolution”).  7. After the renovation works had been completed, Sun Wah was the only owner which did not pay its share of the contributions pursuant to this resolution.  Legal proceedings were instituted against Sun Wah for the recovery of such contribution, but they were subsequently discontinued for reasons which are not material to this appeal.  8. Between 1999 and 2001, the Manager proceeded with further renovation and repair works (“the 1999/2000 works and the 2001 works”) without first obtaining the approval of the owners at an owners meeting. After the works had been completed, a deficit appeared in the accounts of the building.  9. By August 2001, the Grande Group became the owner of 363 shares in the building and thus its majority owner.  An owners meeting was convened by the Manager and subsequently held on 26 September 2001.  It was attended by all the owners, the Manager and the lawyers respectively representing Sun Wah and the Manager.  A total of 10 resolutions were passed by a majority of 367 to 255 (“the 2001 resolutions”).", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 2, "file_name": "FACV No. 2 of 2006.jsonl"}

Sun Wah refused to comply with these resolutions.  In exercise of its powers under clause 6(a) of Schedule 4 to the DMC, the Manager then commenced two actions against it for its share of contribution. In the first action (HCA 4741 of 2001), the claim is for the sum of $2,581,481.67, or alternatively $1,548,099.00 with interest.  It is based on the 1997 resolution and resolutions (1), (2) and (3) of 2001 as mentioned above.  The Manager has subsequently abandoned reliance on resolution (3), acknowledging that this might be contrary to the DMC and the lesser amount is now being claimed. In the second action (HCA 5207 of 2001), the Manager relies on resolution (10) and claims for the sum of $886,817.17 being Sun Wah’s share of the deficit in the building’s accounts.  11. These two actions were consolidated and heard together before Deputy Judge To who dismissed both actions.  The Manager’s appeal was dismissed by a majority of the Court of Appeal (Rogers VP and Le Pichon JA, Reyes J dissenting).  12. In the first action, Sun Wah pleaded that the 1997 resolution was invalid on three grounds: (1) no proper notice of the meeting was served; (2) the notice of meeting was defective in that it did not set out the intention to pass the resolution in question; and (3) the 1997 resolution which was retrospective in effect was not empowered by the DMC or the Ordinance.  The trial judge found that proper notice had been given to the owners in accordance with the DMC but held that the 1997 resolution was invalid on grounds (2) and (3).

He relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision in So Chun Man Paul v Incorporated Owners of Chee On Building [2000] 1 HKC 732, saying that the present case was on all fours with that decision. 14. In the second action (HCA 5207 of 2001), Sun Wah alleged that the deficit was incurred unreasonably and improperly and that the 2001 resolutions were retrospective in effect and hence “void and ineffective”. The judge held that insofar as the deficit arose from the 1999/2000 works, the 2001 resolutions were retrospective in nature and had no effect; and insofar as the deficit arose from the 2001 works, while he would not query the propriety of such works, he did not think it appropriate to order Sun Wah to pay contribution.

In upholding the judge’s conclusion that the 2001 resolutions could not impose liability on Sun Wah, the majority of the Court of Appeal held that these resolutions could not be passed for two main reasons: (1) they only required the owners to make contributions for the costs of renovation works which were carried out between 1997 and 2001 without prior authorization, but did not sanction the unauthorized works. Since there was no power under the DMC to levy contributions for the costs of unauthorized works, these resolutions fell outside the purpose and purview of the DMC; and (2) even if the 2001 resolutions were to be read or framed as giving sanction for carrying out the unauthorized renovation works, such resolutions had violated Sun Wah’s rights in that it had lost the opportunity, before the works were carried out, to persuade other owners not to approve such works or to reduce the amount of works involved. The Manager having previously failed to pass a proper resolution could not be put in a better position after the Grande Group had acquired a majority interest in the building and be allowed to obtain a retroactive sanction of what it could not obtain earlier. 17. Reyes J who dissented in the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge was wrong to rely on the case of So Chun Man Paul to come to his conclusion because retrospectivity did not arise in the present case and that in any event, the resolutions in question were valid under clause 10 of the Fifth Schedule in the DMC notwithstanding any retrospectivity.

Ratification is usually used in the context of an agent purporting to act on behalf of his principal to create a contractual relationship between his principal and a third party without his principal’s authority. The existence of the principal’s ratification of what the agent has done is necessary in order to fix liability either on the principal or the third party. This is not the case here. We are dealing with the relationship between the agent (the Manager) and the principal (the owners). What was sought to be done at the owners meetings was to approve or sanction what the Manager had previously done without the owners’ authority for the purpose of obtaining contributions from them.

It makes no sense to say that the resolutions only required contributions towards the costs of the works, but did not at the same time sanction such works.

A resolution is contrary to the provisions of the DMC under clause 10 (iii) if it contradicts or is opposed to or inconsistent with any provision in the DMC.  Resolution (3) of the 2001 resolutions which purported to charge interest in excess of that allowed under clause 16 of the DMC is such an example.  There is nothing in the DMC which in any way prohibits the owners from passing any resolution which takes retrospective effect. Such a resolution cannot be regarded as contradicting or opposed to or inconsistent with any provision in the DMC. 34. In the management of multi-storey buildings, it is important that the Manager and the owners are entitled to make appropriate decisions unless such decisions are prohibited by the DMC.  Numerous matters, whether trivial or important, may surface from time to time and on very short notice.  They need to be attended to.  Things need to be done very quickly.  However, there are procedural requirements for convening an owners meeting where approval can be obtained before action can be taken. That is why the Manager is given wide powers by the DMC.  But however detailed and comprehensive the DMC  may be, it cannot cover all exigencies.  There must be occasions when it is necessary to sanction what has been done before the owners can meet, discuss and approve it. Subsequent sanction or approval is also necessary to correct mistakes, cure defects or remedy oversight.  Resolutions for such purposes are very often retrospective in effect.  If resolutions which take retrospective effect are to be regarded as invalid simply because they deal with matters which are not expressly empowered by the DMC, it would hinder the  efficient management of the building.   35.

For the reasons given by Reyes J, I respectfully agree that there is no good ground for holding that a resolution is invalid simply because it takes retrospective effect. I see no reason why resolutions with retrospective effect should be any different from those with prospective effect unless by their retrospectivity, they are against the law or contrary to the provisions of the DMC or so unfair as to amount to minority oppression.  Clause 10 of the DMC expressly provides that majority resolutions are a means through which owners make decisions concerning the management of the building.  All resolutions, whether prospective or retrospective, are bound to affect the existing rights of the owners in one way or another, some adversely and others beneficially.  There is no basis for saying that retrospective resolutions are invalid because they affect the owners’ rights or “bring about unstable factors”.   As to the situation after a transfer of ownership, I also do not see any difficulty. Former owners are not bound by resolutions passed after they have ceased to be owners of the building (see the sections 39, 40 and 41 of the Conveyancing and Property Ordinance, Cap 219 and clause 18 of the DMC).  New owners can always make provision for indemnity or compensation against former owners for any liability which former owners would have been responsible for had they continued to be owners of the building.  In any event, there is nothing unfair in new owners sharing with other co-owners of the building any burden for prior works which runs with the land if they are also entitled to any benefit which may arise from the works carried out in the building.  It must be borne in mind that decisions have to be made from time to time for the better and more efficient management of the building and that all owners have accepted this mode of management by agreeing to be bound by the DMC.

In the present case, Rogers VP took the view that since there was no power under the DMC to levy contributions for the costs of unauthorized works, the 2001 resolutions were outside the purview of the DMC.  Le Pichon JA agreed with him and added that these resolutions were for this reason also contrary to the DMC.   In my view, once it is accepted, for the reasons discussed above, that the 2001 resolutions had validly sanctioned the unauthorized works, this objection falls away.  The renovation works in question are no longer unauthorized and resolutions requiring contributions among the owners must take effect.  As a matter of fact, under clause (1) (q) of the Second Schedule in the DMC, all owners are obliged to pay for all charges which the owners may resolve by a resolution as necessary or requisite for the proper management, operation and maintenance of the building or for the improvement or maintenance of the services, amenities or facilities thereof.

This is all the more so when there had been a change in the shareholding in the building resulting in the Grande Group now having a majority.

Proper notice of the meeting was given to all owners who were well aware of the agenda and the purpose of the meeting in advance.  Discussions were held (in fact arguments were made) at the meeting.  There is nothing to show that any owner was not permitted to challenge the renovation works or any part thereof or to persuade other owners not to approve them or to reduce the amount incurred.  I do not see how it can be said that Sun Wah or indeed any owner had lost the opportunity to raise objections if he or it had so wished.  From the minutes, they did raise objections.
