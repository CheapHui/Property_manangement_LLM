Section 44 provides: “(1) The Authority may from time to time prepare, revise and issue Codes of Practice giving guidance and direction as to – (a) the procurement of supplies, good and services required by a corporation including such procurement by invitation to tender and the tender procedure in respect thereof; (b) the standards and practices of management and safety that are to be observed and followed by a corporation including standards and practices relating to – (i) building management; (ii) building safety; ...

Paragraph 3.7.1 provides that the procurement of all supplies, goods and services shall comply with the Code of Practice on Procurement of Supplies, Goods and Services issued by the Authority under section 44 at Appendix B. 23. Appendix B contains 11 paragraphs. They set out the following. Paragraph 1 Virtually identical to s.20A(2). Paragraphs 2 and 3 Procedures for inviting tenders. Paragraph 4 Number of tenders to be sought. Paragraph 5 Closing dates of tenders. Paragraph 6 Procedures at the opening of tenders. Paragraph 7 Tenders below the value in paragraph 8 shall be submitted to the management committee for acceptance or rejection. Paragraph 8 Tenders of a value exceeding $200,000 or 45% of the corporation’s annual budget (whichever is lesser) shall be submitted to the owners corporation for acceptance or rejection in general meeting. Paragraph 9 - Period during which the tender documents, contracts, accounts and invoices are to be kept by the management committee.

In the Scenic Villas case, the issue was whether paragraph 8 of the Code of Practice imposed a statutory limit on the Management Committee’s power to commit the owners to contracts valued at more than $200,000. The applicants (some of the owners of Scenic Villas) submitted, relying on paragraph 8 of the Code of Practice, that the Management Committee had no such power. 26. The judge held (and affirmed on review) that the Code of Practice had no legislative force because the definition of \"subsidiary legislation\" in s.3 of the Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance cap. 1 did not include a code of practice. Further, there was no provision in the BMO that required the Code of Practice to be published in the Gazette, whereas s.28(2) of the IGCO provided that publication in the Gazette was a requirement for subsidiary legislation. (The Code was in fact published in the Gazette). 27. It was also part of the judge’s rationale that paragraph 1 of the Code was identical to s.20A(2). He considered it inexplicable that that should be the case if the Code was already subsidiary legislation. 28. Apparently the judge was not addressed by counsel on this point and there was no elaboration. However, I would think it highly arguable that the logical conclusion from this is that those parts of the Code of Practice that were incorporated specifically into s.20A - i.e. as s.20A(2) and s.20A(4)- were intended by the legislature to have the force of law.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 11, "file_name": "CACV 2442003.jsonl"}

In paragraph 11.2 of his written decision, the judge referred to his decision in the Scenic Villas case and considered that the analysis he had undertaken (in deciding that s.20A(1) was only directory) also applied to s.20A(2) and s.20A(3). He held that as the Code of Practice was not law, there was no contravention of the statute if the provisions of the Code of Practice were not complied with.\n\n31. With respect to the judge, it is in my view highly arguable that this reasoning appears to be syllogistic. Although the Code of Practice may be merely directory, it does not follow that certain specific paragraphs - extracted from the Code and made into specific primary legislation - were also directory. It is at least arguable that when paragraph 1 of the Code of Practice (and not say, paragraphs 2 - 6) was incorporated as s.20A(2), the effect of that incorporation was that that particular paragraph acquired the force of law as primary legislation. The same goes for that part of paragraph 9 of the Code of Practice which was incorporated as s.20A(4). It is at least arguable that otherwise s.20A(2) and s.20A(4) would be superfluous.\n\n32. In another action involving Million Fortune Industrial Centre, The Incorporated Owners of Million Fortune Industrial Centre v Jikan Development Ltd and Another [2001] 3 HKLRD 588, Deputy Judge To endorsed Judge Chow’s view in Scenic Villas and apparently there was no argument by counsel on the point. The judge considered only \"the status of the Code\", without distinguishing those paragraphs of the Code that were incorporated into primary legislation from the other paragraphs that were not. In any event, the judge held that even if \"the Code\" were mandatory, it did not affect the issue before him, which was the costs of litigation between parties in an action.\n\n33.

Section s.20A(2) (which has been set out in paragraph 6 above) provides that services which are likely to exceed $100,000 \"shall be procured by invitation to tender\".\n\n36. When a statute declares that a thing \"shall\" be done, the natural and proper meaning is that a peremptory mandate is enjoined. Exceptions to the natural and proper meaning are where the thing to be done refers to (a) the time or formality of completing any public act, not being a step in a litigation, or accusation; or (b) the time or formality of creating an executed contract whereof the benefit has been, or but for their own act might be, received by individuals or private companies or corporations, in which case the enactment will generally be regarded as merely directory (Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases 5th ed. Vol. 5 p.2404).\n\n37. Counsel for the Respondent sought to argue that the second exception applied in the present case. With respect, I find that argument difficult to understand. On the face of it, that exception deals with only the time or formality of executing a contract in situations where the other party has already performed the contract, or where one party would have received the benefit of contractual performance by the other party but for its own acts.\n\n38. The thing to be done under s.20A(2) is the issue of an invitation to tender, where the identity of the other contracting party has not even been considered. At that stage, no contract would have come into existence yet, so there could not have been any performance or attempted performance of contractual acts.\n\n39. Mr Chun’s submission based on the decision of the Court of Appeal in yet another Million Fortune case, The Incorporated Owners of Million Fortune Industrial Centre v Jikan Development Ltd and Plotio Property and Management Ltd CACV 122/2000 did not assist his case.

It was also submitted for the Respondent that there was no specific remedy for contravention of s.20A(2). However, it is at least arguable that at common law, where the intended consequence of the failure to comply is not stated in the legislation, the thing done under the statute is invalidated. Whether the thing done is wholly void or merely voidable depends on the circumstances (Bennion, Statutory Interpretation 4th ed Section 10, pp. 32-35).\n\n41. The Application sought an order \"voiding\" the appointment. If the Applicant were to succeed at trial, it would be for the tribunal to decide whether the appointment was void or voidable and depending on the facts found, on what terms e.g. on the basis of a quantum meruit.\n\n42. It was also submitted for the Respondent that the remedy for contravention of s.20A(2) lay in s.40B. Section 40B provides: \"(1) Where it appears to the Authority in the case of any building having a management committee that - (a) no person is, for the time being, managing that building; (b) the management committee has, in any material particular, failed substantially to perform the duties of a corporation under section 18 including, without limitation, the duty of a corporation under subsection (2A) of that section to have regard to and be guided by the Codes of Practice and (c) by reason of the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs (a) and (b), there is a danger or risk of danger to the occupiers or owners of the building, the Authority may order that, within such reasonable period as shall be specified in the order, the management committee must appoint a building management agent for the purposes of managing that building\".\n\n43. In my view, the remedy available to the Authority under s.40B applies only in the situation where the facts set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) have occurred. This is a specific, additional power given to the Authority in the rare situation of a risk of danger to occupiers being posed by lack of management.
