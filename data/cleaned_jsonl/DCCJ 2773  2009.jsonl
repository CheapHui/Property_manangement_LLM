He asked the Management Office to follow-up the matter. However, the Management Office was unable to gain access into Flat 7B and was unable to contact Mr. Chow again.\n\nii) Mr. Chow called the Management Office at last on 30 September 2008 and arranged for an inspection of Flat 7B on the same morning. Mr. Chow's own technician, Mr. Lau, attended the inspection and performed a water leak test by letting water into the bathtub of Flat 7B. Water leak was then observed at Flat 6B. Mr. Lau performed some repair to the drainage pipes of the relevant bathtub.\n\niii) This repair was not effective and Madam Chan still complained of water leakage on 3 October 2008. Mr. Lau returned on 6 October 2008 and performed further tests. Mr. Lau discussed with Mr. Chow and the tenants of Flat 7B was advised not to use the guest bathroom for 2 days.\n\niv) Despite this, the water leakages continued. The Management Office staff found wetness on the ceiling above the water-heater in the guest bathroom of Flat 6B and suspected that the source of the water leak was from the water pipes of the water heater of Flat 7B. Mr. Lau was notified and he said he would inform Mr. Chow the possibility of turning off the water heater supply of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B for a water leak test.\n\nv) Mr. Lau eventually inspected Flat 6B on 14 October 2008 but thought that this was not a burst water heater pipe at Flat 7B. He suggested that this was due to sand and debris under the bathtub which was retaining the water.\n\nvi) Nevertheless, the water leakages continued. On 28 October 2008, Mr. Lau turned off the water heater supply of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B.\n\nvii) Despite this, the water leak continued. On 31 October 2008, Mr. Lau decided to turned off the master fresh water supply of Flat 7B for a further water leak test.\n\nviii) At last, the water leak started to slow down and the dripping finally stopped on 3 November 2008, some 50 days after this period of water leak first started.\n\nix) When Mr. Lau opened the master fresh water pipe on Flat 7B on 4 November 2008, he observed wetness on the water heater pipes. However, Mr. Lau was still not sure whether this leak was from Flat 7B or the flat above.\n\nx) Mr. Lau therefore devised a test. He advised shutting off the master fresh water supply for another day and arranged an inspection of Flat 7B the next day. If the water heater pipe was found to be wet, the source of the water leak would likely be from the flat above. If it remained dry, the source would most likely be from the fresh water pipe of Flat 7B.\n\nxi) As arranged, on the next day (5 November 2008), two staff members from the Management Office inspected the water heater pipe of Flat 7B and found it to be dry, thus showing that the source was from Flat 7B. Mr. Lau was notified.\n\nxii) As what appeared to be a second test for confirmation, Mr. Lau returned that evening to re-open the master fresh water pipe of Flat 7B. He inspected Flat 6B afterwards and found no immediate water leak.\n\nxiii) However, Madam Chan complained the very next morning, on 6 November 2008, that the water leak increased since the re-opening of the master fresh water pipe of Flat 7B.\n\nxiv) The Management Office staff went up to Flat 7B and found that the left water pipe in the water heater was wet while the right water pipe was dry. Mr. Lau was notified and he advised shutting off the fresh water supply again.\n\nxv) Therefore, Mr. Lau was careful that he repeated his water leak test to confirm that the source of the water leak was, indeed, from the fresh water pipe of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 8, "file_name": "DCCJ 2773  2009.jsonl"}

It should therefore be obvious, at least to the parties instructing them, that the experts were on cross-purposes right from the beginning: whilst Mr. Wong sought to address the water leak problems past and present, Mr. Ho only sought to address the water leak problems found at the time of inspection on the assumption that there was a continuous on-going one (perhaps relying on the information that there were water leaks during heavy rain in Flat 7B).\n64. This is confirmed by the fact that, when the Court presented the scenario as stated in the Management Report regarding the water leak between September and November 2008, Mr. Ho readily accepted that \"there was a big possibility\" that fresh water pipe leakage from Flat 7B was to account for that.\n65. Mr. Ho then sought to explain himself by stating that he did read the Management Report but thought that it was \"speculation\" for an expert to rely on matters not \"observed first hand\". He argued that he did not want to speculate so his opinion was based only on what he found during the inspection.\n66. There were major flaws in this argument :-\ni) It was simply wrong for an expert to reject outright any evidence simply because this has not been \"observed first hand\" by the expert. To draw an example, a doctor would not be able to (and might not wish to!) \"observe first hand\" every single complaint made by his patient but he would not disregard such information. Disregarding the history of a case was a rejection of an essential part of the investigation, especially in this case because, as discussed above, there appeared to be no further substantial water leak problems at the time of the investigation. Basing an opinion on all available evidence was not \"speculation\". If Mr. Ho was in doubt of the reliability of the Management Report, he should interview the witnesses (for example, the Management Office staff, the Plaintiffs and especially Mr. Lau) to verify the accuracy of the history. There should not be any difficulties in doing so as part of his investigation.\nii) Having rejected, as it appeared, the Management Report on this basis, Mr. Ho appeared to accept the evidence from the tenant of Flat 7B about the incidents of water leaks during heavy rain. Mr. Ho obviously did not \"observe first hand\" such water leakages either. This was an obvious act of \"cherry picking\" at the evidence.\niii) To support Mr. Ho's opinion that the source of the water leakages was from the external walls, the Defendant sought to rely on the fact that several (but not all) complaints of water leaks appeared to coincide with the dates of typhoons or rainstorms. The Defendant did so by cross referring relevant dates in the Management Report to the Hong Kong Observatory records. Mr. Ho readily accepted these dates in the Management Report as evidence but did not provide any reason why he should accept the part of the Management Report which appeared to support his opinion whilst rejecting other parts which did not.

Mr. Ho's opinion has further problems : i) It manifestly failed to explain why the water leaks subsided after November 2008 when no repair was done to the external wall all this time. ii) This theory also failed to account for how there could be a continuous water leakage for a period of some 50 days when it was self -evident that there could not have been a continuous rainstorm or typhoon over this period. iii) Putting it in another way, there would be many days over this period of 50 days when the water pressure exerted by (and the duration of) any rainstorms must have been below that of the \"Spray Test to window of Guest Bathroom of Flat 7B\", yet the water had leaked continuously throughout this time when the subsequent \"Spray Test\" yielded no leak. iv) Further, in order to explain the multiple sites of water damages observed in Flat 6B, Mr. Ho proposed an elaborate theory of multiple areas of water entries at the external walls and podium floor tiles , cracks through various parts of cement rendering, cracks though the entire concrete structural walls at various exact areas, cracks inside the concrete ceiling slab of the guest bathroom of a length through exact areas , cracks on the guest bathroom wall tiles allowing simultaneously an internal source of water leak (from the shower of guest bathroom of Flat 6B through to the boy's bedroom wall) etc.. These pathways were illustrated in the Sketch enclosed in Mr. Ho's Report. v) Besides what he claimed as various defects observed in the external walls, podium floor and guest bathroom wall, Mr. Ho could not produce any evidence of these internal cracks and water pathways. Thus, these internal cracks and water pathways were based upon pure assumptions. vi) To account for the episode of most significant water leaks , all these elaborate network of cracks and defects would have to \"appear\" (or substantially \"appear\") more or less simultaneously and spontaneously around September 2008, only to \"disappear\" more or less simultaneously and spontaneously around November 2008, and not to \"re -appear\" again despite there having no repair done to the external walls, podium floors, or bathroom wall tiles. vii) The inherent improbability of this happening is mind -boggling, especially when compared to what was the glaringly obvious source of water leak from the Management Report: that there was a fresh water pipe burst in the guest bathroom of Flat 7B in September 2008 and it was replaced in November 2008.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 23, "file_name": "DCCJ 2773  2009.jsonl"}

In contrast to the elaborate and improbable model proposed by Mr. Ho, Mr. Wong showed the Court a much simpler and more logical scheme of how water flow from this one source of water leak (that is, the fresh water pipe burst) could account for all the water damages observed in Flat 6B. 81. Having considered all the evidence before it, the Court finds that there have been multiple sources of water leaks over time, as follows :- i) From the fresh water pipes which have accounted for the most substantial amount of damages between the period September to November 2008. ii) From the bathtub of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B including all the facilities of the bathtub including the U-trap drain etc.. iii) From the seams around the bathtub and ceramic walls of the guest bathroom of Flat 7B which has been repaired at various points of time. 82. It is not possible now to assess the exact contribution to the overall water leakage damage from bathtub and facilities and the seams around the bathtub and the ceramic walls :- i) There were evidence before the Court that various sealants and bathtub surroundings have been repaired at various times over the years. ii) Although the bathtub facilities were not replaced until July 2010, the extent of water leakage from this source would obviously be related to the actual amount of usage of the bathtub. However :- a) The earlier tenants were a couple so the likely amount of usage of the guest bathtub would be low. b) They were also advised at some point not to use the bathroom. c) Flat 7B was unoccupied between around 30 April to 1 August 2008. 83. Although the effect of condensation was observed by both experts on the bottom of the bathtub, the Court would discount this as a source of water leakage for the following reasons :- i) The experts accepted that the volume under the bathtub was limited to no more than 2 to 3 cubic metres. ii) This volume of air was relatively enclosed under the bathtub. It was self-evidently not open to the atmosphere. As such, the maximum amount of water vapour that could be contained by this volume of air would be limited. iii) Condensation could only occur where the air was in direct contact with the under surface of the bathtub. As a mostly enclosed space, there would be little air movement. Without significant air movement, only a limited amount of air would come into contact so the amount of water formed by condensation would have been far less than the maximum amount of water that the whole volume of air could hold. iv) Further, condensation would only occur at those times when there was a temperature difference between the bathtub and the enclosed volume of air underneath it, for example, when cold water was placed in the bathtub above. This would limit the time that condensation could take place. v) As such, the effect condensation could not have explained the continuous water leakage of more than 1 litre a day for around 50 days. No sound scientific model has been put forward by the experts to show that this could happen. vi) In fact, Mr. Ho agreed that if this was the extent of the water leak, it was not likely to be caused by condensation under the bathtub. vii) Therefore, any water formed by condensation could not have led to any significant water leakage or damage.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 25, "file_name": "DCCJ 2773  2009.jsonl"}
