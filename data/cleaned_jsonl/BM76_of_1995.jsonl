It is unfair and impracticable to require an owners incorporated to produce proof of compliance with every law in force in Hong Kong and every clause in the deed of mutual covenant whenever an interested party challenges an act or omission of the owners incorporated. Where a party is alleged to have breached the law, the general rule is that the burden of proof lies on the party who asserts the breach. However, there is also a well established exception that the burden is shifted to the defending party if the assertion constitutes in effect a negative averment and the balance of convenience lies on the defending party to produce proof of compliance with the law. In this case, the applicant made a negative averment specifically referring to building regulations. I think the balance of convenience lies on the owners incorporated to prove compliance with those regulations. This can be done by the respondent either calling upon the Building Ordinance Office to give evidence or producing expert evidence from qualified engineers in private practice. In the premises, until the respondent has produced evidence to my satisfaction regarding compliance with building regulations within a reasonable period of time, I am prepared to order the removal and discontinuance of use of the installation.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 7, "file_name": "BM76_of_1995.jsonl"}

The literal interpretation of this paragraph is that it prohibits the erection or construction of any thing on any common part of the building that may be used for the propagation of information or messages. The antenna installation in question here is also a device for the propagation of information and messages. I do not think it is appropriate to draw an artificial distinction between propagation through visual contact and propagation through radio waves. A modern expansive interpretation of Clause 5(t) should be adopted.

There is discretion given to owners incorporated by section 18(2)(f) to make better use of the commons parts only by establishing lawns, gardens and playgrounds.
