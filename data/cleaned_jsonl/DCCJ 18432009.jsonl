IPM suspected the water leakage had probably originated from Flat 5A and asked him to turn off the valve inside the guest bathroom at Flat 5A to suspend the fresh water supply to the guest bathroom. He did so, but was informed the condition at Flat 4A did not abate. On 27 July 2008, at the suggestion of IPM, the fresh water supply to Flat 5A was shut down during the daytime. However, the water leakage problem at Flat 4A did not stop. Mr. Kam found the water marks on the walls of Flat 5A still remained. On 29th July, the staff of IPM informed him that the situation at Flat 4A was deteriorating and suggested shutting down the fresh water supply at Flat 5A entirely for most of the day leaving only a couple of hours during the morning and evening for water supply to Flat 5A. He complied with the request, but was informed that in spite of the shut down of the fresh water supply to Flat 5A, Flat 4A’s leakage problem had continued, he also found the water marks on the walls of Flat 5A had remained. Mr. Kam therefore suspected the source of water leakage to Flat 4A did not originate from the fresh water supply to Flat 5A. On 30 July 2008, at the request of Mr. Leung of Flat 4A, he allowed Mr. Chan to inspect Flat 5A to investigate the cause of leakage into Flat 4A. Mr. Chan told him the water leakage was caused by the under floor fresh water pipe at Flat 5A running from the guest bathroom through the living room into the kitchen. Mr. Chan also told him that the design of the building had such a fresh water pipe installed under the floor to supply hot water to the kitchen. On 1 August 2008, Mr. Kam found a pool of water on the window sill in the living room, as water was running continuously from the window sill, he immediately reported it to the management office. After Mr. Leung and Mr. Chan inspected Flat 5A on 2 August 2008, Mr. Chan insisted the water leakage at Flat 5A was caused by the fresh water pipe under the living room floor.

Mr. Kam claimed he had confirmation from his contractor Mr. Au Yeung that there had been some modification work done to the fresh water supply pipes to Flat 5A resulting in the installation of fresh water supply pipes running along the external walls of the unit before Mr. Kam and his family moved into Flat 5A. Consequently, the original fresh water supply pipe was abandoned before Mr. Kam became a resident of Flat 5A.

He put a towel at the window sill to absorb the water, but as the amount of water was large, water continued to leak from the towel, he had to put two containers to collect the water from two locations to hold the water from the window sill.

It was Mr. Chan’s evidence that in order to supply hot water to the kitchen, units in the building were installed with fresh water supply pipes embedded in the floor between the guest bathroom and the kitchen.  Mr. Chan pointed to photographs 10 to 11 and 16 to 18 of Appendix 3 of the Defence ’s expert report and Appendix I of the joint report showing cold and hot water supply pipes from the gas heater at the guest bathroom at the external wall of the guest bathroom of the building leading back into the floor slab of Flat 5A.  Mr. Kam disagreed with Mr. Chan, he pointed out that the floor slab of Flat 5A was below the point of entry of the fresh water pipes indicated by Mr. Chan in the photograph.  He believed they led back to the bath tub area rather than the floor slab of Flat 5A (p. 259 of Bundle A).", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 24, "file_name": "DCCJ 18432009.jsonl"}

He had also had an opportunity between 27 July and early August 2008 to inspect Flats 5A and 6A.  He claimed he had ruled out the water leakage at Flat 4A had come from Flat 6A because he had visited Flat 6A on 1 August and found the bathroom floor of Flat 6A to be dry.  He had also checked the supply of potable water at Flat 6A and found there was no running water because the owners of Flat 6A had turned off the fresh water mains and the unit was vacant at the time.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 25, "file_name": "DCCJ 18432009.jsonl"}

Although he did not check under the floor boards of Flat 5A to see whether there was indeed an embedded fresh water supply pipe running from the guest bathroom to the kitchen, he based his claim from his experience as a plumber at Baguio Villa estate where many units had the same embedded fresh water pipes to supply hot water to the kitchen from the guest bathroom.  He agreed the Defendant’s photographs showed an electric water heater inside a cupboard in the kitchen, but he claimed the electric water heater shown in the photograph was not in use because the electric power supply to the Baguio Villa units were insufficient to support the kitchen electric water heater and the air conditioners in the same property if they were used at the same time.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 26, "file_name": "DCCJ 18432009.jsonl"}

Based on the evidence adduced and from the experts’ report, the answer to this question must be yes. The next question is whether the water seepage was from the fresh water supply pipe embedded underneath the floor board of Flat 5A or was it from the flush water supply from Flat 6A running through Flat 5A into Flat 4A? As can be seen from the photographs and from the evidence of the witnesses, it is not disputed the floor of Flat 5A at the window and the corridor outside the guest bathroom was soaked with water. Water stains on the timber flooring can clearly be seen in the photographs. Mr. Leung, his plumber Mr. Chan and Mr. Kam all agreed the Flat 5A flooring around the living room and the corridor near the guest bathroom was wet with the timber flooring buckling. The Defendant’s expert Mr. Lau measured the wall partition at the guest bathroom, the living room and along the corridor, the moisture level was extremely high. The same level of moisture was found in the timber floor outside the guest bathroom along the corridor. The ceiling and walls at Flat 4A had begun to show signs of water seepage on 27 July 2008. The inference therefore is, the water seepage must have come through the Defendant’s premises.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 28, "file_name": "DCCJ 18432009.jsonl"}

Para. 20-135 and para. 20-136 of Clerk and Lindsell on Torts 20th ed. provided:- “When a shop in an arcade was let to a tenant, and water from the roof of the arcade got into the shop owing to an accumulation of rubbish in the pipe by which the water was carried into the sewer, it was held that the landlord was not liable in the absence of negligence, as the arrangements for carrying the water from the glass roof to the sewer were for the joint benefit of the tenant and the landlord. Negligence in relation to cisterns If the landlord retains control of a cistern for the supply of water to flats in his building, he is not liable to his tenants for a burst in one of the water pipes, or an escape of water from the cistern, unless he is negligent. The occupier of the flat in which the cistern is kept is also free from liability in the absence of negligence. Where a water-closet in an upper floor got out of order, without any negligence on the part of the occupier of the upper floor, and flooded the lower floor, the occupier of the upper floor was held not liable to the occupier of the floor below. If water from a burst pipe in one flat causes damage to another flat in the same building, the occupier of the first flat is not liable without negligence.” Para. 20-138 further stated: “Person liable for damage caused by water When accumulated water escapes and does damage, the person liable is he who has accumulated the water or caused it to be accumulated. The employment of an independent contractor is no defence, as Rylands v Fletcher itself shows. If the water is accumulated on land the occupier is liable because it is his water which has escaped.”", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 29, "file_name": "DCCJ 18432009.jsonl"}

It is not possible to determine if the Defendant was negligent without identifying the cause of leakage. The Plaintiff claimed the Defendant had failed to maintain the fresh water supply pipe embedded in the floor slab between the guest bathroom and the kitchen at Flat 5A resulting in the leakage to Flat 4A. The experts agreed that fresh water supply pipes had been installed along the external walls of Flat 5A, they can be seen in the photographs produced. Mr. Kam did not agree there was a fresh water pipe embedded underneath the floor from the guest bathroom to the kitchen in Flat 5A. This claim of embedded fresh water pipe to supply hot water from the gas heater in the guest bathroom to the kitchen of Flat 5A had not been established. It was a bare assertion of Mr. Chan who claimed from his own experience as a plumber. The burden is on the Plaintiffs to show there was a leaking fresh water supply pipe buried underneath the floor boards of Flat 5A in July and August 2008. Furthermore, the independence of Mr. Chan has been challenged as he is related to the Plaintiff. Mr. Man’s expert evidence is also tainted by the faulty information given to him by Mr. Chan. 38. The management office incidents report recorded the water leakage into Flat 5A had ceased when the flush water supply in unit A of Block 22 was shut down on 7 August and 14 August 2008. Even though water leakage into Flat 4A had continued, it was indisputable that the leakage of water into Flat 5A had come to a halt and leakage reappeared 50 minutes after the flush water supply was turned back on. This indicated the leakage into Flat 5A came from the flush water supply system. Furthermore, when on 26 August 2008 upon the installation of a temporary valve at the flush water supply pipe of Flat 6A to shut down the supply, the water seepage problem at Flat 5A abated on the next day.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 30, "file_name": "DCCJ 18432009.jsonl"}
