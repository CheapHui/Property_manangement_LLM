Portland Street runs to its rear, parallel with Nathan Road. It also has a service lane off Portland Street. Built in the early 1960’s, it is a twenty-six story concrete block of commercial enterprises up to and including the 10th floor and mainly residential units from the 11th floor to the top. At least that was how it was originally intended to be. By 1997 its condition showed all the signs of poor management: dilapidated decoration, illegal and haphazard extensions and installations, and a poor state of repair of essential services. Having had the opportunity of seeing parts of the interior and exterior of the building, I find descriptions afforded in Mr. Ian Cullen’s report are if anything, an understatement. The material part of the 3rd floor is squalid and derelict: the external wall and the scavenger lane are cluttered with old bamboo scaffolding, tarpaulin sheets, rusting installations, and all types of obstacles. It is difficult to believe that there has been any attempt at essential management. It is a hazardous area. It reeks of neglect. A comparison with photographs taken in 1991 shows a significant deterioration but, as far as one can tell from such photographs, the state of affairs appeared uncontrolled and unpleasant even then in 1991.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 1, "file_name": "1995 No. P.

It had “full and unrestricted authority to do all such acts and things necessary (for such management).… including power to enter into contracts and engage…. contractors, workmen etc”. The Defendants have erroneously relied upon Clause 3(a) of the Deed of Mutual Covenant which vested in Sun Hing Realty Ltd., its successors or assigns “the exclusive right to use, occupy and enjoy the exterior walls and canopies of the said building…. provided the said company, its successors or assigns shall at the same time be the owner of one or more undivided share or shares in the said premises and building.” The second column of the 4th schedule of the Deed sets out the portions which are excluded from that exclusive right. Those portions relate to the theatre premises of the building that are delineated on certain plans attached, and such portion of the exterior part of the building as were shown on plans no. 6A and no. 6B annexed to the Deed in the ownership of South China Amusement Co. Ltd. This clearly does not include the exterior wall facing onto the scavenging lane. That wall was covered by the description in that 4th Schedule “and all the other portions of the exterior parts of the said building” which remained vested in Sun Hing Realty Ltd. By Clause 11, Sun Hing Realty Ltd. or its nominee, was the First Manager “of the said premises and of the building and shall have the right to the management of the said premises which shall include the operation, servicing, maintenance and repair of the said premises and the said building.” Sun Hing Realty Ltd. was formally dissolved or wound up on the 18th May 1971. From that time it clearly had no interest in the building. The management committee had taken over its role and the right of use occupation and enjoyment of the exterior walls and canopies were vested in the Incorporated Owners. Clause 14 provided that upon Sun Hing Realty Ltd. “relinquishing the management of the said premises and building, there shall be a Management Committee to be elected by the owners of the said premises and building…. the Management Committee shall have the management of the said premises and building which shall include the operation, servicing, maintenance and repair of the said premises and building.” I have already dealt with Clause 16 sub-clause (2)(b) of which provides that “all acts and decisions of the Management Committee (in respect of such matters as aforesaid) shall be binding in all respects on all the owners for the time being of the said premises and building.” It is clear therefore that for at least two decades Sun Hing Realty Ltd. had no interest in or responsibility for any part of the premises including the external walls because it did not exist and the advice that the Management Committee had received from their surveyor, a Mr. Raymond Chan Yuk Ming was inaccurate.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 2, "file_name": "1995 No. P.

On a number of occasions this business was asked to quote for certain necessary work in the building by the Incorporated Owners through their Management Committee. It was not the only contractor engaged by the owners so to do. If the quotation was acceptable, Mr. Fu carried out the work. He employed casual labour and possibly some permanent labour. The owners also employed a plumbing and electrical worker, no doubt for routine straightforward tasks of maintenance and repair, which could be managed single-handed. His name is Lai Chi Lung. He had a supervisor, a Mr. Lai Chung Tat. Mr. Lai Chi Lung knew some of the workers employed by Shun Cheong Electrical Co. and that the Incorporated Owners always asked Shun Cheong to carry out plumbing and electrical repairs. On the 21st February 1991, the Plaintiff in this action, Mr. Ta Xuong, together with another plumbing and electrical worker, Mr. Wong Man On, both employed by Shun Cheong, were doing some renovation work for one of the tenants on the 10th floor of the building. They had a break for some tea in the middle of the afternoon and met up with Mr. Lai Chi Lung in the building. There is some dispute about whose idea it was that they should all have tea together, but that was what resulted. Mr. Lai Chi Leung told the Plaintiff and Mr. Wong that he was experiencing difficulty in tracing a leak in a water pipe. There is some conflict about what resulted from the discussion about this. To the Factory Inspector in March 1991, Mr. Lai made a statement in which he set out that his supervisor told him to ask Shun Cheong’s people to have a look and this is what he did, asking the two workers to help find out which pipe was leaking. In his oral evidence, Mr. Lai departed from this earlier version and alleged that the Plaintiff and Mr. Wong took it upon themselves gratuitously, as it were, to solve his problem for him. This later version upon which the Defendants substantially rely is, at best, implausible. The written statement made to the Factory Inspector less than two months after the incident concentrates on the problem which he had been experiencing for some time. It clearly sets out that he had authority to seek the assistance of Shun Cheong’s workers and that he did so. The Plaintiff and his colleague agreed to help.

He noticed a recently fractured piece of bamboo scaffold pole to the left of the window out of direct sight but clearly visible when one looked out of the window to the left.  It was at the end of that section of scaffolding.  The leaking or burst pipe in question was also believed to be to the left but had not been seen from the window in the ladies toilet.  He could also see a piece of pole dangling from a slightly lower level and he obtained a better view of this when he went down to the ground floor level to the scavenging lane.  Photographs recorded both these aspects.  Mr. Hau’s opinion of the bamboo scaffolding was that it was old, to judge from its colour, and abandoned or disused.  I am satisfied that the Plaintiff’s fall was caused by a fracture of defective bamboo scaffolding, either under foot or at a higher level where its purpose was to serve as a protecting barrier.  In either event it failed in its purpose.  That bamboo scaffolding should not have been there.  It served no current purpose as far as I can ascertain.

That it had at some stage served a useful purpose in a contract for some external work is clear enough.  On the evidence it is equally clear that it was no longer being used for its original purpose.  Mr. Hau says he has often become aware of the existence of abandoned scaffolding remaining in situ.  It has just not been removed by the contractors responsible for its erection, or by the owners and/or management of the building.  It may be a question of expense, but it is clear that it deteriorates quickly and is not maintained in a safe state.  The prime responsibility for the continued existence of such scaffolding, which has ceased to fulfil its original function, is that of the building owners who caused or permitted it to be there in the first place even if it was originally erected by the contractors themselves.  Whilst it remains connected to the building, they, the building owners, remain responsible.  Their remedy is quite simple.  Either they require the contractors to remove it - I do not doubt the cost of provision, erection and removal was reflected in the contract price - or they themselves cause it to be removed.  It is an invitation to burglars who can gain access to the higher floors of the building without having to go through the main entrance.  It is also an open invitation to anyone required to do any work to the exterior of the building to use it and rely upon it as a means of access and support.  Mr. Lai Chi Lung in his evidence said that he always climbed out of the windows and the scaffolding posed no problems for him.  Mr. Lai Chung Tat said he believed the scaffolding in question was still in situ, or at least part of it was. In this case there was no good reason why the Incorporated Owners should not have required the erecting contractors to remove it or have it removed themselves.  They were singularly neglectful in this regard.  On the occasion of my own visit to the premises it was clear that there were still sections of bamboo scaffolding in position.  Most of it, possibly all of it, was old.  There were broken sections, gaps and what appeared might be renewed sections.  As a whole it served no useful purpose.  Once the Incorporated Owners had left the scaffolding in situ they were responsible for its maintenance and repair.  It was foreseeable that anyone seeking to carry out any external work, or simply an inspection, would feel the scaffolding was there to enable him to do so.  It was equally foreseeable that there was a risk of fall, collapse and injury on scaffolding that was not maintained or complete.  The Incorporated Owners liability under the Occupiers Liability Ordinance was clear.  They owed a duty of care to the Plaintiff.  They were in breach of that duty and negligent.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 6, "file_name": "1995 No. P. I. 496.jsonl"}

Mr. Lai in turn had been encouraged to seek help from Shun Cheong’s workers if he could.  The problem had been untraced for several days.  The Incorporated Owners employed Mr. Lai and his supervisor to carry out necessary work, and employ when necessary, outside workers.  The management, therefore, was vicariously liable for any actions by their employees or agents in the proper discharge of their functions.  There existed no warning against or prohibition on the use of the scaffolding to carry out such work.  The Plaintiff and his colleague already on the premises to carry out work for their employer were nonetheless entitled to the duty of care on the part of the occupiers.  Having agreed to assist in tracing the pipe in question which required external inspection - the water was spraying externally - they were entitled to rely upon any scaffolding in position as being there to assist or facilitate such work.  The fact that the Plaintiff was willing to assist either out of genuine good will or with the view to encouraging the owners or management to ask his employers to carry out any remedial work, does not lessen the duty of care towards him.  There was no contractual relationship but he was entitled to the same standard of care as if Mr. Lai Chi Lung had himself ventured on scaffolding to trace the source of the leak.  Mr. Lai Chung Tat said that there were often problems with leaking pipes and that Mr. Fu’s business (Shun Cheong) was often asked to deal with it and that he normally made contact himself, but some times asked Mr. Lai Chi Lung to ask Mr. Fu to look at the job.  He said in respect of this incident that he had asked Mr. Lai Chi Lung to ask Mr. Fu to assist if he came across him.  It is not surprising, therefore, that Mr. Lai Chi Lung told the Factory Inspector that Mr. Lai Chung Tat had told him to ask Shun Cheong’s people to have a look.  In evidence, Mr. Lai Chi Lung had said that he knew where the leak was coming from (i.e. the 3rd floor) having traced its site from his position in the scavenging lane.  In that case, he would not need the Plaintiff’s help which was in effect what he was trying to say.  He is in my view wholly wrong and probably confused, perhaps by reason of the lapse of time, perhaps by reason of his age.  Perhaps also in some part he feels a degree of responsibility for the accident and is trying to convince himself that the circumstances were different.  What he told the Factory Inspector was reasonably proximate in time to the incident and more consistent with the other evidence I have heard.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 7, "file_name": "1995 No. P.

It is important to state that I accept his evidence in its entirety as to how he came to assist Mr. Lai; he had been prevailed upon to give help. It clearly called for external observation at or near the point which could be traced as the source of water. There was no reason why he should question the safety of using the scaffolding in question. There had been various works carried out externally and as far as he knew these were continuing, either for the owners as a whole, or for individual owners. The fracture and fall occurred very soon after he stepped onto the scaffolding. Unfortunately, the Plaintiff’s memory of the immediately preceding events has been affected by the trauma. There is no evidence to suggest anything was wrong with the scaffolding on visual inspection from the open windows. Mr. Hau’s attention was directed to the broken section and the dangling pole. I am satisfied that there was no contributory negligence on the Plaintiff’s part.

I have referred to the evidence of Mr. Ian Cullen on behalf of the Plaintiff at an earlier stage, and also in passing to that of Mr. Raymond Chan on behalf of the Defendants. The justification for and ambit of expert evidence was extremely limited in this case. However, the Defendants undoubtedly placed some reliance on the report they received from Mr. Raymond Chan Yuk Ming, a chartered surveyor. To his report he attached a schedule of his experience in maintenance works. It included a contract with the Defendants described as “ongoing” and “surveying/repair”. He said that his secretary had made a mistake and that the contract was complete. Furthermore, although described as “surveying/repair” it related only to some electrical work in the building, particularly the main cable. He said that the state of that was still substandard. Mr. Chan had visited the site in question yet nowhere in his report was there any description of what he found, nor was there any criticism of or disagreement with Mr. Cullen in this respect. In answer to my question he virtually said that what he saw was the same as Mr. Cullen had seen two months earlier, although he later tried to say that he disagreed with Mr. Cullen’s criticism that there was “generally a poor state of repair of many services”. He said he would substitute the word “some” for “many”. Mr. Chan has no expertise in relation to the erection, use and maintenance of scaffolding.

Following the accident the Plaintiff’s wife gave up her employment. She had been earning $40,320.00 per annum.  The first period is whilst the Plaintiff was in hospital and she was making daily visits (apart from a short period when she gave birth to her daughter).  It covered virtually a complete year.  I have considered Housecroft -v- Burnett 1986 1. A.E.R. p. 332, wherein the Court of Appeal indicated as a guideline that the commercial rate for such care would be the ceiling.  In Hogg -v- Doyle (unreported - Kemp & Kemp - The Quantum of Damages 51061.), the Court of Appeal upheld an award for care by the wife, who was a nurse, based on one and a half times her earnings.  The court opined that since she was doing the work of at least two full-time nurses, a claim based on that cost would have been justified.  A differently constituted Court of Appeal, but one containing at least one former practitioner in the field of personal injury litigation, decided in Fitzgerald -v- Ford 1996 P.I.Q.R. Q72 that Hogg v. Doyle laid down no rule as to the uprating of the carer’s loss of earnings as the measure for care.  It is clear that the nature of the care and the nature of the employment surrendered, all have some influence on the proper level of remuneration.  In this case I am satisfied that the Plaintiff’s wife was to provide the level of care which would justify two carers.

The claim is put on the basis of $7,500.00 per month - $88,125.00 for the near-year period.  I think that is extremely reasonable.  The dedication, and self-less impeccable care which she has given, at great cost to her own mental and physical well-being is covered by the reports and evidence. The second period is from his discharge from hospital to date of trial, a period of 68 months. (5 2/3 years).  The cost claimed is the sum of $15,000.00 per month, which is some where between the cost of a Chinese care assistant and a China Trained Nurse.  Again I consider that figure to be a reasonable one.

Dr. Choa, the consultant neurologist agrees with this estimate.  The Whiteneck Report (1995 Edition) is a detailed consideration of long-term survival of spinal cord injury victims.  The long-term quality of care received by such persons, with many psychosocial factors, are important determinants of survival.

Pneumonia remains the greatest threat but the other threats to life in normal healthy persons have taken over as leading causes of death.

Septicaemia remains the third highest cause of death but life expectancy is expected to continue to improve.  Respiratory complications remain a significant threat and on all the evidence this must be particularly so in the cases of complete quadriplegia.  This Plaintiff falls within the Frankel Grade A, B, C of quadriplegia and deducing the reasonable life expectancy from the table in the Whiteneck paper applicable for a person who has survived at least one year from the injury, it is in the region of 23.7 years statistically.  This of course is based upon data which ceased in 1992 the mid-period of which was 1982.  It does not reflect the relatively optimistic approach in the latter part of the paper.  However I have to bear in mind the following statement in that paper:  “There is common misconception, often expressed by many rehabilitation professionals, that as a result of recent medical advances, life expectancy for persons who survive the first post-injury year is either normal or reduced by at most 10%.  While much progress has been made, there is clearly no justification for such statements.”  A little further on is a caveat in respect of the statistical tables from which I have extracted the life expectancy period:  “Great caution should be exercised when applying these figures to individual cases for several reasons.  First, considerable variability in injury severity exists within each neurologic group….  For example, the tabulated life expectancies for persons in neurologic group 1 (Plaintiff’s group) would be…. underestimates for persons who were not ventilator dependent….  Moreover the effect of numerous psychosocial factors and the anticipated life time quality of care are also not considered, although they are difficult to quantify.  Therefore more precise projections should be made for specific persons only by matching such characteristics of the individual as the exact neurologic level  of injury and Frankel grade, age, gender, race, ventilator status, length of post-injury survival to date, presence of pre-existing or unrelated concurrent medical conditions, motivation in self-care, and availability of good medical care to the largest possible sample population.”", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 17, "file_name": "1995 No. P.

The Plaintiff’s wife has coped hitherto but at such cost to herself in terms of her health and mental stress that she cannot reasonably be expected to continue.

The annual cost is $151,840 X 18 = $2,733,120.  Domestic Help   Although the nursing burdens will no longer fall upon the Plaintiff’s wife once she has the two China trained carers, others will remain.  She is not physically fit and the past strain has taken its toll.  She needs domestic assistance.  She still has two children to cope with and, for a while at least, such a helper, if or when in possession of a driving licence, can give support when the Plaintiff is taken out in the vehicle.  When the children are fully grown and virtually independent, and “pulling their weight” in the home, the need for and justification for such domestic assistance will have gone.  It will have to be full-time and residential until that stage.  The cost is $46,320 per annum plus a relief cost of $2,100 per annum when the helper goes on biennial leave, totalling $48,420 per annum.  The Plaintiff’s daughter is now 6 years of age.  When she is 16 (and her brother will then be 21 years old) she should be in a position to help her mother.  The domestic helper will have a ten year tenure.  The appropriate multiplier is 7.

Compensation is understandably rejected as an accurate term to use.  Equally conventionally, certain types of injury and concomitant disabilities have attracted certain awards.  There is always an arbitrary aspect to such awards.  I intend to set out what I regard as the essential features of quadriplegia (or tetraplegia) distilled from a variety of cases, how I should approach these in terms of the awards for such an extreme state, and the degrees of quadriplegia accepting that these variations are probably themselves of marginal significance to the sufferer and then relate the Plaintiff’s position to them with what I regard as the appropriate award.  I intend to exclude any consideration of that evaluation which is accompanied by brain damage which renders the victim unaware of his state.  The quadriplegic state involves paralysis of all four limbs.  In the extreme state the victim is unable to move his head and may be incapable of anything other than facial gestures; he may even be blind.  In such a state he is entirely dependent upon others, within or without the family, for every action essential to survival.  The arguably marginally less severe state is one in which the person is able to move his head, converse fully and use some part of his face or head usefully - i.e. switching items on and off, gripping, for writing or painting, instruments with his teeth.  To all intents and purposes however, he is virtually helpless, totally dependent upon others.  Dr. C.K. Wong described this Plaintiff as being “imprisoned in the totally crippling state of tetraplegia”, “trapped in the most agonising kind of human existence”, and “incarcerated in a body that is nothing more than an absolute burden to him.  “Although these are somewhat emotive phrases they do convey something of the awful state which none but the victim can fully describe.  Perhaps in the past some judges and lawyers have too often used phrases like “standard paraplegic” or “middle of the road quadriplegia” as if the state were common place and readily categorised by an unknowing observer.  There is no sense of privacy; the physical relationship in a marriage has gone for all time, the minimal contact remaining is essentially one-sided.  For a person in the prime of life there is no prospect of a worthwhile substitute career, the ability to share in the bringing up of children has gone, and all these have been replaced by a perpetual sense of being a burden, however professional and sensitive the therapist or counsellor may be.

One of the reasons is that no sufficient distinction is made between awards for quadriplegia and paraplegia on the one hand and those for other catastrophic states such as total blindness and deafness, which awards themselves are not sufficiently differentiated from other but less devastating injuries. It is well-known that awards for neck and back injuries (short of paralysis) were for a significant period in the past undervalued in terms of damages. An important feature in the overall scale of evaluation is that it is only in the past 40-50 years that the courts have been concerned to assess damages for paraplegia, and perhaps more recently than that for tetraplegia because few survived the initial trauma, succumbing to shock, pneumonia or urinary infections. There has been a concern to keep the level of damages in line with conventional assessments for other types of injury for good reason - there is always a risk of assessment being determined by emotive considerations (as are jury assessments), and there is a need for consistency. But that has acted as a straitjacket rather than as a dispassionate judgment reflecting fairness and recognition of obvious disparities. As the lower end of the scale simple fractures have perhaps attracted excessive awards, at least by comparison with the major injuries. Another area in which a more realistic assessment of damages is currently being made is psychiatric injury but, here the ambit of assessment is very wide indeed and quite complex.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 33, "file_name": "1995 No. P.

Leung On and another [1996] H.K.L.R. Vol.2 p.401 the Court of Appeal upheld the learned trial judge (Mr. Justice Peter Cheung) in his level of awards for various categories of injuries on the basis that they were correct at the time of its own judgment. The case was concerned with other aspects of awards of damages with which I need not be concerned here. The upper two categories were “gross disability” - $660,000 to $1m; and “disaster” - $1 million upwards. The Court of Appeal’s decision was in July 1996. Mr. Justice Cheung in Ng Kwok Wing v. Lau Ping Kwan & others - 23 May 1996, awarded the Plaintiff, also paraplegic as a consequence of his injuries, $1.5 million. The Plaintiff in that case suffered a number of other injuries including fractures of the ribs, and left tibia and a rupture of the diaphragm. An extensive infection of the right hip developed requiring operations. As a consequence, the right hip is frail and he needed support for the lower limbs when being transferred from the wheelchair. He was at trial, 47 years of age, and living, wholly inappropriately, in a home for the aged, a most depressing environment which served only to accentuate his disabilities. His wife was too depressed and traumatised to cope with his disability.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 34, "file_name": "1995 No. P. I. 496.jsonl"}

Wong, Dr. Brian Choa and Miss Alice Tsang. Desperate though the circumstances of that Plaintiff undoubtedly were, Mr. Ta Xuong is in a far worse position. He has no upper body mobility whatever, with the exception of his head. He also suffered some additional fractures but given the overall sequelae of the accident these, like those of Mr. Ng kwok Wing, merge into the disastrous physical state. For the past six years although not having to endure the environment of the Fu Ka Home, he has seen his wife worn and stressed to the limit of her endurance trying to cope within the confines of a very small home. To what extent should one reflect the difference between Mr. Ng Kwok Wing’s disastrous state which has left him with some upper body strength, the ability to use his hands, operate his chair himself so as to manoeuvre and provide a degree of independence inside and outside his home including feeding himself, and that of Mr. Ta Xuong who has none of this, albeit diminished, ability? It is not possible to quantify this in terms of percentages so as to reach a figure. Nor can one look at lesser states of disability and apply a multiplier. There must be some regard too for the constraints imposed by the need to respect a conventional approach to awards.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 35, "file_name": "1995 No. P. I. 496.jsonl"}

That is itself a factor to be put into the equation. Mr. Justice Cheung’s approach has been echoed by Mr. Justice Leong’s award, in Choi Mei Ho v. Liu Yuk Wah - 20 March 1997, of the sum of $1.5 m. for a 46 year old woman with a reduced life expectancy and features which were very similar to those of Mr. Ng Kwok Wing - and of course the Plaintiff in this action. These awards are then the starting point for my assessment of the pain, suffering and loss of amenity element of Mr. Ta Xuong’s claim. The difference in disability is significant. This, too must influence the psychiatric consequence. In terms of life expectancy there is a greater risk for Mr. Ta. The almost total loss of human physical contact is a factor not to be overlooked - at best he is a passive recipient. I need not dwell upon all the features which are set out in the reports fully. In my view the proper award is one of $2 m.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 36, "file_name": "1995 No. P. I. 496.jsonl"}
