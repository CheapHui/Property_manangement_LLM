The plaintiff contends that clause F-1 only requires a majority resolution of the owners being passed in accordance with section H. It further contends that section H-1(g) and (h) provide that it is the resolution by the majority of the shares as owned by the owners present. Since the owners present at the meeting had 1,505 shares, which were more than 10 per cent of the 5,040 shares required for a quorum, and these owners voted all their shares in favour of the resolution, the plaintiff therefore says that the resolution was that of the majority in accordance with section H.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 9, "file_name": "HCA17452005.jsonl"}

The defendant contends that the words at the end of clause F-1 should be grouped into two phrases, namely “upon a majority resolution of the owners” and “being passed in accordance with section H hereof.” Mr Pang, counsel for the defendant, argues that it was not unusual for different resolutions to have different requirements for validity. He cites, as an example, paragraph 7 of the Seventh Schedule of the Building Management Ordinance which requires the members or owners of an incorporated owners who own not less than 50 per cent of the shares to vote for a resolution to terminate the service of a manager. However, paragraph 5 of the Third Schedule of the Ordinance only requires a 20 per cent quorum for the dissolution of a management committee and a 10 per cent quorum for other matters. He therefore submits that clause F-1 requires the resolution to be passed by the owners who own not less than 50 per cent of the shares of the commercial portion. 12. Regarding the second phrase, he says that save the definition of the majority vote, all the provisions in section H should apply to clause F-1. These provisions deal with the matters concerning the calling of the meeting, the entitlement to the number of votes, the election of chairman, the casting vote, and so on. Mr Pang further submits that since a resolution under clause F-1 should be made by the owners who own not less than 50 per cent of the shares of the commercial portion, the quorum for such a meeting should therefore not be as small as the owners of 10 per cent of the shares of that portion. He submits that the quorum should be the owners who own at least 50 per cent of the shares of that portion. He further argues that if the plaintiff is right, the words as bracketed in his two phrases would be redundant or are surplusage.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 10, "file_name": "HCA17452005.jsonl"}

It was an easy task. 14. I also do not agree that the words at the end of clause F-1 should be grouped into two phrases so as to define the majority vote in a different way from that as defined in section H. Such reading of clause F-1 is artificial. I take the view that the words at the end of clause F-1 do not stipulate a majority resolution of all the owners of the commercial portion. This clause merely stipulates a majority resolution of the owners to be passed in accordance with all the requirements of section H, which included the requirement of the majority only of the owners present and not of all the owners of the commercial portion.

In this case there is no evidence that any other owner of the commercial portion would be adversely affected by the declarations sought.

I come to this conclusion without any discomfort because there is evidence that the plaintiff has informed all the owners of the commercial portion three times about the existence of this action and none of them has deemed it necessary to come forward and ask to be joined.
