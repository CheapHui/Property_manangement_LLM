What is of significance is that the detailed allegations which have been made by Mr. Wong have not been rebutted by evidence from the Plaintiff.  Perhaps most significant of all Mr. Wong referred to four documents which were sent to the Plaintiff giving details of the joint venture two of which arguably indicate that the disposal of the proceeds of sale of the shopping centre were to be divided proportionately to the amount invested by the  participants.

I have carefully considered all the matters raised by the defence. I intend no disrespect to Sir John when I say that his arguments may sow some seeds of suspicion, but they do no more than that.

To try to expose a defendant ’s vulnerability to the imposition of a condition by artificially regarding a plaintiff as though he were a defendant served no useful purpose and was capable of being misleading. The same applied to tentative assessments of respective chances of success, and relative strengths of good or bad faith, in a case where both sides had a great deal of explanation to make of apparently questionable conduct, including the swearing of affidavits. It was proper to look first at the defence in isolation, to see whether there was lack of good faith or whether the defence was a sham. But if one of those flaws in the defence was found, the decision as to the imposition of a condition could not properly be made before an examination was also undertaken of the plaintiff ’s case, having regard to any attack made on it by affidavit. If that examination aroused suspicions that the claim might be made in bad faith, that there was something shadowy about it, or that it might be tainted with illegality, no measuring, however approximate, of the respective degrees of possible bad faith should be made, nor should any opinion be expressed, however tentative, as to which case appeared to be stronger at that time. The present case was a classic instance in which, in principle, the court should give unconditional leave to defend. There were features of both claim and defence, as so far explained, which were disturbing because they bore the appearance of falsity and disreputable business dealings.” It was not a proper exercise of the discretion to undertake weighing exercise of the nature undertaken by the Judge.

The Plaintiff has elected to seek summary judgment in respect of one of four alternative causes of action pleaded. It sues for what it says is the outstanding balance of some US$2.5m on a loan agreement or, as it has been called, an “IOU” dated 28th September 1992, between itself and the Defendant. The original loan is said to have been in the sum of US$5m. The Plaintiff says its case is simple. The document was signed with the Defendant’s company seal affixed, the money was duly advanced by a cashier order and, on the terms of the document, the Defendant undertook an unconditional obligation to repay the sum advanced within 6 months. It says that it is wholly irrelevant what, if any, use the Defendant may have put to the money, in particular, whether it used it for investment in any particular project. The Defendant ’s defence is that the whole of this arrangement was, to the knowledge of both parties, a sham and that the obligations set out in the loan agreement or IOU cannot be taken at face value. That document was entered into in order to conceal from banking regulators on the mainland, the unauthorized investment in Hong Kong real estate by certain sub-branches of the Bank of China, through the Plaintiff. The genuine agreement, so the Defendant alleges, was for the Plaintiff to participate as an investor, with other investors, in the acquisition and eventual sale of a shopping complex in Sham Shui Po. The money purportedly advanced to the Defendant was in fact intended by all concerned to be invested, via a company called Century Liaison Limited, in that project. The Plaintiff, like the other investors, was to fund the project by making the money available to Century Liaison as a long-term loan and, on completion of the project was to participate in a share of the proceeds of sale. The Defendant says that the project went ahead and in fact resulted in a loss. It alleges that the Plaintiff, along with the other investors received a distribution of the proceeds realised on sale of the property and that the amount now claimed as the alleged balance of the loan represents no more than the deficit suffered by the Plaintiff on the project.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 8, "file_name": "CACV 25899.jsonl"}

The importance of there being doubts or suspicion as to the validity of the Plaintiff’s case is that such doubts detract from the Plaintiff ’s right to summary judgement. It was not to the point to dismiss them on the basis that they did not improve the quality of the defence and “raise it” beyond the category of “shadowy”. If possibly genuine weaknesses were exposed in the Plaintiff ’s case, this casts doubt on the Plaintiff ’s right to invoke the summary procedure in the first place. In my judgment, the judge should have adopted the approach applied by the English Court of Appeal in Extraktionstechnik Gesellschaft fur Anlagenbau mbH v Oskar (1984) 128 S.J. 417. As appears from a Lexis transcript of the judgment made available to us (although, it would seem, not to the judge), Watkins LJ., who gave the judgment of the court stated (after reviewing the evidence) as follows: - “We have said enough to demonstrate the intricate and, in part, as the hearing of this action may very well reveal, unsavory nature of this litigation. It is, of course, impossible to tell now where the truth lies and how much, if any, of the activity of both Plaintiffs and Defendant is tainted with illegality. What is, in our judgment, abundantly clear is that justice cannot possibly be said to be done until the acute issues which have been raised upon the affidavits have been resolved in a contested action. There appears to be ammunition available to both parties capable of inflicting serious wounds. We would not presume to be capable of assessing the chance of success for one as opposed to the other. Nor is it possible to predict what effect one kind of illegality or another, if established, will have upon the Plaintiffs or Defendant or both. If those comments are justified, can the imposition of a condition upon the Defendant’s right to defend possibly be maintained? We most certainly would not impose a condition upon the Defendant. But that of itself is insufficient reason for declaring that the exercise of their discretion successively by Master Waldman and Webster J. was erroneous.” His Lordship pointed out that Webster J. had framed the issue as one of principle, namely: “as to whether leave to defend which would otherwise be made conditional should still be made conditional when there are doubts about the Plaintiff’s case”. The principle as decided by the English Court of Appeal appears as follows: - “We agree that it is proper to look first at the defence in isolation, in order to see whether there is a lack of good faith or the defence is a sham and so forth, in the course of considering whether the Defendant can discharge the burden of establishing that he should have leave to defend. But the decision as to the imposition of a condition, if one or more of those flaws in the defence is found to exist, cannot, in our view, properly be made before an examination is also undertaken of the Plaintiffs ’ case, having regard to any attack that has been made on affidavit upon it. If that examination arouses suspicions that the claim may be made in bad faith or there is something shadowy about it or, worse, that it may be tainted with illegality, no measuring, however approximate, of the respective degrees of possible bad faith should be made and no opinion expressed, however tentative, as to which case appears to be the stronger at that time. That in our judgment is a classic instance in which in principle the court should give unconditional leave to defend. We do (sic) regard this case. On any view of it, including Webster J. ’s other observations to which we have not referred, on charge and counter-charge, we fail to see how it can rightly be said other than that there are features of both claim and defence, as they are so far explained, which are disturbing, because they bear the appearance of falsity and disreputable business dealings. It would not be seemly in this judgment to be more expansive than that about those features.”", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 10, "file_name": "CACV 25899.jsonl"}

In the light of the necessity for the matter to proceed to trial (unless settled), it is undesirable that I should go into any detail as to such outstanding issues. Suffice it to say that the relevant evidence includes evidence (i) of Century Liaison (as opposed to the Defendant) making payments characterised as interest and capital payments to the Plaintiff without demur on the Plaintiff ’s part; (ii) various communications, including financial reports relating to the project, describing the Plaintiff as an investor alongside other investors, and received without exception being taken by the Plaintiff to such description; (iii) the endorsement on one such communication by a highly -placed bank official", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 11, "file_name": "CACV 25899.jsonl"}

He submits, in my view, with some force, that this is an additional source of suspicion as to the viability of the Plaintiff’s claim.  Mr. Benjamin Yu SC (appearing with Mr. Johnny Mok on behalf of the Plaintiff) invites the court to reject the defence of “sham” on the grounds that no affirmant filing evidence on behalf of the Defendants has said in terms that the  loan agreement sued upon is a sham.  In my judgment, while it is true that none of the affirmants expressly use the word “sham”, that defence arises in the substance of their evidence, which duly condescends to particulars.   It is therefore my view that the present case is one in which the evidence discloses difficulties to be faced by both sides at the trial.
