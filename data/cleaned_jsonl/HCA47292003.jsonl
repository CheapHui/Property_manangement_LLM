On this further line of defence, the defendant’s engagement would only have ended on 30 June 2003 and not 31 May 2003. Counsel for the defendant in closing submissions added a further line of defence, namely that since the defendant was appointed the building manager of the building, it was in the same position as the first manager which was a party to and appointed by the DMC of the building. Under the DMC, the manager had the right to resign but could not be removed by the owners. Counsel thus argued that the only way for the owners to terminate the defendant’s engagement was by following the procedure in paragraph 7 of the 7th Schedule of the said Ordinance.

Clause 28(ii) of the DMC further provides that: “(ii) In the event however of incorporation of the owners in accordance with the said Ordinance the Corporation shall be vested with all the right duties and obligations imposed on the Management Company and subject to any provisions herein and any extension or modification thereof,...” 12. The position of the management company or manager as carved by the DMC is very analogous of that to the plaintiff as an incorporated owner. Once the plaintiff was incorporated, there was no more room or need for the existence of the same management company or manager as before. Its role would be taken over by the plaintiff. Any manager appointed by the plaintiff would not occupy the same position as the manager appointed prior to the plaintiff’s incorporation. Hence I hold that the defendant was not a manager as appointed by or under the DMC. It was just a temporary manager appointed by the plaintiff pursuant to its powers and duties in the said ordinance.

The next defence is whether the defendant’s engagement would only have expired on 30 June 2003 upon the appointment of Eastpoint and not on the earlier date of 31 May 2003. The resolution of the AGM was not worded entirely satisfactorily. It referred to the temporary appointment for a maximum period of four months but was appended at the end with a phrase saying “until a permanent building manager is appointed, via tender process”. However, the expression “a maximum period of four months” appeared twice and the owners obviously contemplated that the tendering process would take about four months. They therefore resolved to engage the defendant for four months. Another possible construction is that the temporary engagement would last until a permanent manager was appointed but in any event subject to a maximum of four months. Either way, the engagement would automatically end no later than the expiry of the four months, even if there was still no appointment of a permanent manager. 14. The resolution was not to engage the plaintiff for four months and then extend the engagement to the time when a permanent manager was appointed, if no appointment was made within the four months. The phrase “appended to the resolution” merely described the event to happen within the four months and not an extension of the engagement.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 9, "file_name": "HCA47292003.jsonl"}

Mr John Lee, who was responsible for making the contract with Mr Kong of the defendant, said in paragraph 10 of his witness statement: “10. At the subsequent Management Committee meeting held on 25 January 2003, at which Kant Kwong, director and General Manager of the Defendant, also took part, the Defendant verbally agreed to accept the Plaintiff’s appointment as temporary property manager for a period of 4 months commencing from 27 January 2003 until 26 th May 2003. The Defendant’s acceptance of such engagement was duly recorded in the Minutes of the said Management Committee meeting.” 17. The record in the minutes of the management committee meeting was, however, brief. It merely said that Mr Kong had, in accordance with the appointment in the AGM, verbally agreed to take over the temporary management of the building as from 27 January 2003. 18. The documents emanating from the defendant may be more telling. On 27 January 2003 the defendant furnished a letter signed by Mr Kong to the plaintiff.

However, he added in the same breath that he understood the appointment was for four months until the appointment by the plaintiff of a permanent manager. In cross-examination, he agreed that the term of employment that Mr John Lee had agreed with him was four months and he insisted that he had made it clear to Mr Lee that a three-month notice of termination was required before the engagement could be determined. In re-examination, he further said that he had agreed with Mr Lee to have a four-month engagement with a reasonable notice of termination and he understood that reasonable notice to be of three months. This requirement of reasonable notice or three-month notice cannot be read into the resolution of the AGM on 17 January however one would construe it. The defendant’s temporary engagement also could not have ended both at the appointment of a permanent manager and at the expiry of a reasonable notice or a three-month notice.

On that basis the defendant had also counterclaimed loss of the profits that it would have earned as the permanent manager for two years. This counterclaim was abandoned only at the start of the trial. However, the raising of this counterclaim made the defendant’s case look bad and the credibility of Mr Kong low. This alleged promise did not appear in all the documents sourced from the defendant prior to 11 July 2003. It was only mentioned for the first time by the defendant in a letter to all owners dated 11 July 2003. If Mr Lee had indeed made this promise, which was of crucial importance to the defendant, I cannot imagine why it would not have been referred to in the defendant’s documents prior to 11 July 2003. Mr Kong said that this promise was indeed mentioned in a draft contract supplied by the defendant which had not been signed by the plaintiff and had become lost. I find this only a convenient excuse. There is a further reason why I do not believe Mr Kong on this allegation. Mr Kong has been in the building management profession for 17 to 18 years and of which he was in a managerial position for over three years. He knew that the appointment of a permanent manager for two years could only be decided on by the owners in a general meeting. The promise that Mr Lee had allegedly made could have resulted in the appointment of the defendant as the permanent manager without the matter being considered in a general meeting of the owners. Mr Kong knew that Mr Lee could not have made the promise. When this requirement was raised with him, he said he had forgotten about it. I think Mr Kong must have worked very hard during the defendant’s temporary appointment and was very hopeful that the defendant would obtain the permanent appointment. However, when the owners favoured Eastpoint, he must have been frustrated. Out of frustration, he fabricated this alleged promise to block the appointment of Eastpoint. He could not have forgotten the need for such appointment to be decided on by the owners in a general meeting.
