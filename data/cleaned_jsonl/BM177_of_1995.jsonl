Harbottle Rule  - Consequences o f Breach of Code of Practice - Building Management Ordinance, Cap. 344, s. 44\n\nBy section 44 of the Building Management Ordinance, Cap. 344, the Secretary for Home Affairs may issue Code of Practice which requires at least 5 tenders for award of any cont ract for provision of supplies, goods or services of the value likely to exceed $100,000. An owners incorporated awarded a contract for over $600,000 for renovation of the lifts without going through tender procedure as required by the Code of Practice. Ho wever, the owners incorporated had issued notice in writing of the proposal to award the renovation contract, with relevant particulars such as quotations obtained from two engineering firms, to all its members the majority of whom replied with consent. Se ction 44(2) of the Ordinance provides that a failure on the part of any person to observe a Code of Practice shall not of itself render that person liable to criminal proceedings of any kind but any such failure may, in any proceedings whether civil or cri minal including proceedings for an offence under the Ordinance, be relied upon as tending to establish or to negative any liability which is in question in those proceedings. One member, the applicant, contended that the award was wrong and members had been misled into thinking that a majority had already agreed to the proposal when the notice setting out the proposal was given.\n\nHeld: (1) The requirement of a specific number of tenders by the Code of Practice may be viewed as impractical because an owners  incorporated has no control over how many contractors may submit tenders; querae whether the Tribunal has power to declare the relevant provision in the Code of Practice invalid for being unreasonable and impracticable. (2) Section 44(2) of the Building Management Ordinance is very vague on the consequence for breach of the Code of Practice; in any event, that provision does not render a breach conclusive factor for the consideration of any issue of liability. (3) Granted that there is a breach of the Code  of Practice, it does not necessarily render the decision of an owners incorporated to incur expenses invalid nor does it necessarily absolve its members from liability to contribute to such expenses. (4) Even if there was breach of the Code of Practice af fecting the validity of decision of the owners incorporated, the Foss v. Harbottle  rule should apply to owners incorporated and the majority consent has cured the defect. (4) In the circumstances of the case, even assuming there was breach and having regar d to section 44(2) of the Building Management Ordinance, no order made.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 1, "file_name": "BM177_of_1995.jsonl"}

The parties were in agreement over all the esse ntial facts.

The respondent is at all material times the registered owners corporation f or the said Joyful Villas (\"the Villas\"). The applicant complained of two matters. First, the management committee awarded a contract for renovation of the lifts at the Villas (\"the contract\") without going through tender procedure as required by a Code of  Practice issued by the Authority. This is admitted by the respondent. But the respondent said that before the contract was awarded all members of the Owners Incorporated had been consulted by notice in writing with relevant particulars such as quotations obtained from two engineering firms and each member had given the opportunity to return a written vote on the proposal. This is also admitted by the applicant. The respondent further said that the contract was awarded after receiving support given in writi ng by the majority of the members of the Owners Incorporated. The applicant, on the other hand, whilst not denying a majority of the members had given written consent, contended that members had been misled into thinking that a majority had already agreed to the proposal when the notice setting out the proposal was given.\n3. Secondly, the applicant said that he had been refused the right to inspect minutes of meetings and certain accounts kept by the Owners Incorporated. Mr. Chu for the respondent denied s uch refusal but undertook to deposit the relevant minute book and documents at the Kwun Tong City District Office within two weeks from today so that the applicant can inspect them. Since the applicant indicated in court that he is happy with this arrangem ent, this second complaint was no longer a live issue. The Tribunal, therefore, was left with the complaint pertaining to the renovation contract only.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 3, "file_name": "BM177_of_1995.jsonl"}

Pursuant to section 44 of the Building Management Ordinance, Cap. 344 (\"the Ordinance\"), the Secret ary for Home Affairs may issue a code of practice on building management. It is not disputed that the Secretary for Home Affairs did issue a Code of Practice on Procurement of Supplies, Goods and Services (\"the Code of Practice\"). According to Paragraph 1 of the Code of Practice, the Owners Incorporated must use tender procedure for awarding any contract for provision of supplies, goods or services likely to exceed $100,000 in value. The consideration for the contract awarded by the Owners Incorporated was in excess of $600,000, so the respondent was bound to follow tender procedure. Paragraph 4 in the Code of Practice further says that,  \"The minimum number of tenders to be sought shall be as follows:- (a) 3 in the case of tenders for supplies, goods or ser vices exceeding a value of $10,000 but not exceeding a value of $100,000; or (b) 5 in the case of tenders for supplies, goods or services exceeding a value of $100,000.\"\n5.

The polling result was 214 votes for the proposal, 12 objections and 120 members abstained. The respondent justified the award of the contract on such support. Incidentally, Mr. Chu for the respondent told me that before the contract was awarded, the lady chairperson of the management committee spoke with an officer of the ICAC over the telephone about difficulties with following the tender procedure. The problems was that the Owners Incorporated could face problems in future if the renovation contract was awarded to a firm other than the current maintenance contractor for the current maintenance contract might blame the renovation contractor for careless tampering with lifts thereby causing break-downs not covered by the maintenance contract. In such event, the respondent could be caught between two contractors each putting technical problems on the other. Apparently, the ICAC officer expressed sympathy with the predicament of the Owners Incorporated. Mr. Chu readily admits that the opinion of an ICAC officer cannot over -ride the binding effect of the Code of Practice which is, after all, a statutory instrument having the force of law.", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 5, "file_name": "BM177_of_1995.jsonl"}

What happens if there are not enough tenders? Does that mean that the work should never be done even if it is absolutely necessary? I would have thought that it matters not how many tenders are obtained so long as an open invitation for tender has been duly published and followed through fairly.

It certainly does not enable the Tribunal, as the applicant at one stage suggested, to remove the management committee from office. This case did not call into question any issue of liability. The respondent is not liable to the applicant because he has not paid any contribution towards the expenses for renovation of the lifts. I was told that all except two small owners in the Villas have paid contribution towards the expenses; but the applicant had no locus standi to recover such contribution on behalf of his neighbours nor was he seeking to do so .
