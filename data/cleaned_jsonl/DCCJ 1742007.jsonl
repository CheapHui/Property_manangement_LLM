The Plaintiff’s claims in the action against the Defendant are based on negligence, nuisance and breach of covenants laid down in the Deed of Covenant and under section 34H(1) of the Building Management Ordinance, Cap. 344. The Plaintiff is the registered owner and occupier of 4 th Floor, No. 22 King Kwong Street, Hong Kong ( “P’s property” ). The Defendant is the registered owner and occupier of 5 th Floor, No. 22 King Kwong Street, Hong Kong (“D’s property”) directly above the P’s property. The Plaintiff alleges that ever since she became the owner of P’s property in July 2006, it was found that watery liquid has been seeping through the ceiling in various parts (including ceiling of the living room and the bathroom) of the P’s property. On or about 25 July 2006, the Plaintiff reported the seepage problems to the Joint Office of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Buildings Department (“Joint Office”). The Joint Office conducted a “water ponding test” at the bathroom of D’s property on 25 October 2006 (by ponding up some water mixed with fluorescent dye materials on the floor of the bathroom of D’s property), and a re-inspection was conducted on 17 November 2006 for the results of the water ponding test. In a letter dated 29 November 2006 (“NML-12” in the P’s affirmation), the Joint Office reported that the seepage problems had been probably caused by wear and tear of waterproof layers in the bathroom of D’s property. On the same date, the Joint Office issued a letter which copied the same content to the Defendant’s solicitors saying that the signs of the colour water was found in P’s property on 17 November 2006. The Joint Office thereby also requested the Defendant to effect repair as soon as possible or they would issue a statutory notice to the Defendant prescribing a time within which the Defendant would have to have such repair effected. There being no reply by the Defendant and no improvement to the seepage problem, the Plaintiff issued the Writ on 10 January, 2007. After the Writ was issued, on or about 18 January 2007, a joint inspection was finally agreed, which was undertaken by the surveyors of both parties along with the staffs from the Joint Office. Subsequently, in a letter dated 30 March 2007, the Joint Office issued a letter to the Plaintiff saying that the Defendant told the Joint Office some renovation works had already been completed in the D’s property and requesting a follow-up visit to the P’s property (“NML-22” of the P’s affirmation, Bundle pp.202-203). On 1 August 2007, Mr. Chan Wah Wai David, a surveyor engaged by the Plaintiff, inspected both P’s property and D’s property. He stated that “with the repair works which were carried out in the Defendant’s Property, the seepage of water from the Defendant’s bathroom down to the Plaintiff’s property has ceased.” (Bundle p.240).", "lang": "zh-HK", "chunk_index": 2, "file_name": "DCCJ 1742007.jsonl"}

In particular, the water ponding test result was come under fire. It was submitted by the Defendant that the water ponding test conducted by the Joint Office only revealed only two locations in the ceiling of P’s Property. The Defendant argued that it only corresponded with two out of the six spots as pleaded in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. Further, it was submitted that the test was carried out under extreme test conditions which did not accord with the ordinary usage of the bathroom.

More importantly, the water seepage problem at the ceiling of the bathroom of P’s property ceased after the completion of the renovation work done by the Defendant in response to the demand by the Joint Office to effect repair. It further strengthened the inference and for that matter, the correctness of the conclusion reached by the Joint Office, that the source of the water seepage was coming from the D’s property.
